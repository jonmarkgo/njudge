# this file uses lines of the form XXXX=value, with optional whitespace
# before and after XXXX and the equals sign.  trailing whitespace on
# the value is retained, which should not be construed as a feature

# a line with a hash mark as the first non whitespace character is ignored

# where a line is commented out, it is set to the default so you can see
# what the default is.  where a line is not commented out, it is set
# to a reasonable value (some of the built in defaults are not "reasonable"
# and should be set for a real judge, mostly peoples' email addresses)
