njudge for DEBIAN
----------------------

Comments regarding the Package

The home directory is /home/judge (Yes I know using /home is against
Debian policy.  Some paths are hardcoded in so I can't change them yet.)

Using Sendmail Restricted Shell

If you are using sendmail with the smrsh(1) option, the judge may not work 
correctly.  I haven't quite figured out why.
