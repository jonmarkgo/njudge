   There are two ways to install and set up the judge software: 

   1. with a binary package
   2. by compiling it from source.

   If you are using a binary package, installation will be done for you, so
   only installation from source will be described in this document.

SOURCE INSTALL
==============

   The judge uses GNU autotools in order to configure itself appropriately on 
   your system.

  1. Create a system user account (i.e. 'judge') and its home directory 
     (i.e. /home/judge)  It is ok to lock the password for this account
     as you should never need to login as this user.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     By default it will set up the judge in /home/judge as user judge.
     If you chose a different user and directory in step 1, you can 
     give the configure script flags to override the defaults.  The flags
     are:

     --with-dir=DIR
     --with-user=NAME

     for example to set up the judge in /home/jaldhar/dip as user 
     jaldhar. you would do:

     ./configure --with-dir=/home/jaldhar/dip --with-user=jaldhar

     There are many other flags you can give (type './configure --help' 
     for a full list) but these are the main ones you're likely to use.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. If this is a new install:

       Type `make install' to install the programs, any data files and 
       documentation.  You will have to edit a few configuration files
       before the judge will become operation.  
     
     If this is an upgrade from an older version;

       Type 'make upgrade' to install the new programs only.  

     *Note* compiled programs will not be stripped of debug and other extra 
     information.  If you want to make compiled programs a little smaller, 
     you can type 'make install-strip' or 'make upgrade-strip' instead.  This 
     may give a few harmless errors (when it tries to strip scripts) but you 
     can ignore them.


  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

If you need to tweek the source itself before installing it, see 
docs/README.hackers.
