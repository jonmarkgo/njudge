   There are two ways to install and set up the judge software: 

   1. with a binary package
   2. by compiling it from source.

   If you are using a binary package, installation will be done for you, so
   only installation from source will be described in this document.

SOURCE INSTALL
==============

   The system the judge is to be run on needs to have the following software
   installed:  C Shell, Perl 5.005 or higher, and Sendmail or an MTA with a
   compatible interface to Sendmail such as Exim or Postfix.

   The judge uses GNU autotools in order to configure itself appropriately on 
   your system.

  1. Create a system user account (i.e. 'judge') and its home directory 
     (i.e. /home/judge)  It is recommended to lock the password for this 
     account as you should never need to login as this user.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     By default it will set up the judge in /home/judge as user judge with 
     an email address of judge@localhost and sendmail in /usr/sbin.
     If you chose a different user and directory in step 1, or if judge 
     email should come from a different domain, you can give the configure 
     script flags to override the defaults.  The flags are:

     --with-dir=DIR
     --with-user=NAME
     --with-domain=DOMAIN
     --with-sendmail=SENDMAIL

     for example to set up the judge in /home/jaldhar/dip as user 
     jaldhar and email judge@braincells.com and sendmail in /usr/ucb, you 
     would do:

     ./configure --with-dir=/home/jaldhar/dip --with-user=jaldhar --with-domain=braincells.com --with-sendmail=/usr/ucb

     There are many other flags you can give (type './configure --help' 
     for a full list) but these are the main ones you're likely to use.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. If this is a new install:

       Type `make install' to install the programs, any data files and 
       documentation.  You will have to edit a few configuration files
       before the judge will become operation.  
     
     If this is an upgrade from an older version;

       Type 'make upgrade' to install the new programs only.  

     *Note* compiled programs will not be stripped of debug and other extra 
     information.  If you want to make compiled programs a little smaller, 
     you can type 'make install-strip' or 'make upgrade-strip' instead.  This 
     may give a few harmless errors (when it tries to strip scripts) but you 
     can ignore them.

     If you just want to rebuild the map files (because e.g. you added a new 
     variant,) type 'make remap'.


  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

If you need to tweek the source itself before installing it, see 
docs/README.hackers.
