<h3 class="sec">Making Mapit Maps</h3>

<p>Every few months I get asked for instructions/help on making
maps for either Alain Tesio's excellent <a href=
"http://www.floc.net/">floc.net</a> online Diplomacy mapper. This
page is an attempt at properly documenting the neccessary steps,
and thereby reducing the times I need to re-explain this to
different people.</p>

<div class="ssec"><a name="pre-requisites">
<h4 class="ssec">Pre-requisites</h4>

<p>Before you start, you should have access to the following
software and files:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A vector drawing program which is able to save files as EPS
(encapsulated postscript). Preferably tidy and compact EPS, but
that's rather unlikely these days. I use <a href=
"http://www.xfig.org/">xfig</a>, but it's definitely an acquired
taste. Unfortunately I can't recommend any good drawing programs
for Windows/MacOS.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A copy of Mapit, the mapping program used by (at least) floc.net
and <a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/">DPJudge</a>. You can use
either the <a href="ftp://ftp.onesite.org/pub/mapit.tar.gz">C
version</a> or the <a href=
"http://devel.diplom.org/manus/mapit/dpmap.py">Python
version</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Copies of the Mapit files produced by David Norman's MapMaker.
Specifically, you'll need the .cmap.ps and .info files. The version
of MapMaker that does this isn't publically available, so if you've
just created the variant from ground up with MapMaker, you'll need
to send David you MapMaker map, and he'll send you the neccessary
Mapit files. Otherwise you can get the files used on floc.net from
the <a href=
"http://www.floc.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/mapit/maps/">CVS
repository</a>.</p>

<p><b>Please check that the files are truly up to date</b>. These
instructions will not work with old maps produced by MapMaker.
Currently the best way to determine whether the map is new enough
is to look for the string MapWindowHeight in it.</p>
</li>

<li>A PostScript viewer, for example <a href=
"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/index.htm">GSView</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="ssec"><a name="working_with_mapit_">
<h4 class="ssec">Working with Mapit</h4>

<p>Before making any other changes, you should get Mapit working
with the current maps. How this is accomplished depends on your
operating system, the version of Mapit you're using, and on where
it's installed. For example, with dpmap.py a command line like this
would produce the map as postscript into the file output.ps:</p>

<pre>
$ python dpmap.py <b>./Maharajah1</b> &lt; <b>maharajah.results</b> &gt; output.ps
</pre>
</div>

<div class="ssec"><a name="drawing_the_map_">
<h4 class="ssec">Drawing the map</h4>

<p>You should now draw a map for the variant using the vector
drawing program mentioned before. Please follow these
guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not draw supply centers or province names; they're added by
Mapit.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use a light blue for seas and white for land (to stay consistent
with the current maps on floc.net).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You need to fit the province name, the unit, and possibly a
supply center into the province. If the map contains any small
provinces, you might want to make them larger even at the cost of
geographical accuracy.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Avoid drawing too many details. This will increase the file
size, and make the map harder to read when scaled to a small bitmap
image.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, <a href="maha1.eps">here</a> is the EPS version of
the map for Maharajah's Diplomacy.</p>
</div>

<div class="ssec"><a name="modifying_the_mapit_map_">
<h4 class="ssec">Modifying the Mapit map</h4>

<p>If you're unsure of some of what some of the following parts
mean, you might want to compare the original <a href=
"orig.Maharajah1.cmap.ps">.cmap.ps</a> and <a href=
"orig.Maharajah1.info">.info</a> files to the <a href=
"Maharajah1.cmap.ps">.cmap.ps</a> and <a href=
"Maharajah1.info">.info</a> files that resulted from following
these instructions. If that doesn't help, I'll be happy to answer
any questions you have.</p>

<p>After you update any files, you'll need to rerun Mapit for the
changes to take effect in the output postscript file. Some
PostScript viewers won't notice all changes that happen to a file
that's modified. Zooming in/out should force it to reread all of
the information.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Remove the PostScript functions starting with "Part_", and
replace the calls to those functions in "DrawMap" with a single
call to "doeps".</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Remove everything from function "postmap", except the call to
"grestore".</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add <a href="epsembed.txt">these lines</a> after the "postmap"
function.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add the contents of your EPS file between the "%%BeginDocument"
and "%%EndDocument" lines.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Your EPS file should contain a %%BoundingBox:-header, which
basically describes its dimensions. Usually it'll be something
like:</p>

<pre>
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 1042 1047
</pre>

<p>Modify the definitions of Bottom, Left, Top and Right to match
these values (in the same order). E.g. for the above bounding box
you should have these values:</p>

<pre>
/Top 1042 def 
 /Left 0 def 
 /Right 1047 def 
 /Bottom 0 def
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>The MapMaker template contains some code to automatically detect
whether it should produce a landscape or portrait map. If the map
now appears rotated 90 degrees (as happens to me 75% of the time),
you'll need to modify the line:</p>

<pre>
/PortraitFlag deltah deltav lt def % <b>...</b>
</pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre>
/PortraitFlag false def
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the map is mirrored along the X or Y axis, swap the values of
Left/Right or Top/Bottom.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the map has the wrong aspect ratio, modify the definitions of
MapWindowHeight and MapWindowWidth.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now follows the most tedious part of the process. You'll need to
modify province coordinates in the .info file. Luckily, your
PostScript viewer should be able to show the correct coordinates
when you view the EPS file. Just move the pointer to a province,
and replace the values for the province in the .info file with
those reported by the viewer. The unit will appear right above the
pointer and the name of the province right below it.</p>

<img src="gv.png" alt="GV"></li>

<li>
<p>At this point everything but supply centers should be working
correctly.</p>

<p>The coordinates of the supply center dots are defined near the
end of the file. The coordinate system used is the same as the one
used in the .info file, but shifted a bit downwards. This means
that you can give them a dot the same coordinates as the ones given
in the .info file form, and the dot will appear right below the
name of the province.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="ssec"><a name="that's_it_">
<h4 class="ssec">That's it</h4>

<p>Your map should now be perfect. If something is still wrong, you
can email me the files, and I'll be happy to take a look at
them.</p>
