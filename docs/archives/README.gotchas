1) Be very careful of including files of the form foo.[0-9x] in the data
   directory. The tools that maintain the flist handle them in a different
   way, which can produce some really weird results.

2) Always lock your dip.log (flock dip.log) before you do much of anything
   to the dip directory.

3) Do not use a judge user name with a '-' in it (messes up flist generation).
