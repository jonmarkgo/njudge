<H1>Guide to Working on Njudge</H1>
<P>This document is designed to be used as a guide for developers
working on the Njudge project.</P>
<P>It is designed to be read by those whoare already familiar with
the scope of the project, and are assumed to have relevant knowledge
('C' language) in any standard platform (i.e. Windows or *nix).</P>
<P>A general description of the njudge project can be found <A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/S2002R/Miller/What_is_njudge.html">here.</A></P>
<H2>CVS</H2>
<P>This is the versioning system (Concurrent Versioning System) that
is used to store the njudge code. For those unfamiliar with this tool
the following <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/">link</A>
can be consulted to see the manual.</P>
<H3>Setup</H3>
<P>A specific guide to working with CVS can be found <A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/~njudge/Njudge_CVS_HowTo.html">here</A>.</P>
<H3>Browsing</H3>
<P>You can see the current state of the CVS repository graphically,
using the CVSWeb tool, <A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/~njudge/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi">here</A>.</P>
<H3>Checkout and Checkins</H3>
<P>Files are normally checked out in the standard CVS sense, i.e. Not
reserved. When ready to checkin, it is the responsibility of the
person doing the chekin to ensure that the version is correct, and
not overwritting any changes that a previous person may have made in
the meantime. Though CVS should normally detect and warn for these
situations, this is not always guanrenteed and said warnings can be
ignored.</P>
<P>Files should only be checked in that are compile (and preferably
link) clean, neither giving errors nor warnings. They should be
expected to work, and not be functionally incorrect, such that a
system built with the latest files should work.</P>
<H3>Branching and Tagging</H3>
<P>All work done in CVS should normally take place in the main
branch. Files versions are tagged for each release that they are used
in (see Releases section below). 
</P>
<P>Branches (which in CVS are a type of tag) should only be used for
interim functionality, that is not currently to be generally
released, but it is important to save in CVS (for example, a new
functionality that seems to work but might create problems elsewhere
that are not fully investigated yet). 
</P>
<H2>Bugzilla Bug-reporting</H2>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</A> tool is used
to control the reporting of Bugs. A web interface is <A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/~njudge/cgi-bin/bugzilla/index.cgi">provided</A>
that allows bugs to be reported and controlled.</P>
<H3>Classification</H3>
<P>For njudge, only certain products should have bugs reported
against them. These, and their associated components, are clearly
documented in the Bugzilla setup itself. (Other products exist for
different usages).</P>
<P>Bugs can have on eof a number of serverities. Though the term
'bug' is used, it actually refers to any change, be it a true defect
or an enhancement request. The following types of bugs exist:</P>
