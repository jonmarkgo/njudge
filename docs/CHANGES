-----
(Following come from  former CHANGES and Changelog files)

Mon Jun  9 02:40:32 UTC 1997

The current version being worked on is 9.0.9.  9.0.7 was a massive code
clean up, and should compile under gcc -Wall cleanly.  9.0.8 Was some
hundred variants added in.

Added a sun os section to the makefile listing some make variables that were
needed on a sun machine.

Added a sun section to the bottom of jm.c.  Added the fcntl.h standard
include to dip.c

Fri Oct 10 03:54:46 UTC 1997

Lots of undocumented cleanup.

Removed EP_CUSTODIAN stuff from the code.  It had been commented out.

Sun Oct 12 22:00:00 UTC 1997

name changed to njudge.

version 0.8.1 released

Sun Oct 12 22:09:21 UTC 1997

altered conf.c to put the judge code into the environment when it is set.
that way an intelligent smail script won't need to be altered when
installing or upgrading.  the intelligent smail script has already been
written.

Sun Oct 12 22:43:43 UTC 1997

added a countgames() function to dipent.c

changed main() for all programs to not take a third (environment) argument.
we weren't using it anyway, and it is undefined to do so.

Wed Oct 15 05:21:43 UTC 1997

A config variable (MAXGAMES) can be set to limit the max number of games.

Sat Oct 25 19:31:58 UTC 1997

deleted README.version, README.admin

rewrote version.c to get rid of most of it.  we just include the version
from the makefile and dump it out.  no more of this complicated source fork
tracking.

moved some remaining globals in dip.c to global.c

Mon Oct 27 05:29:31 UTC 1997

deleted getdtablesize() and the code section to close extra file
descriptors.  we weren't likely to have any, and if we do, it's probably
deliberate, so don't muck with it.  and it's wasn't portable.

Tue Oct 28 17:48:25 GMT 1997

added chris brand's patch to either enable or eliminate multiple replies to
an address.  i'm not really sure what it does.  but he wrote it, and wanted
it, and it wasn't unreasonable when i asked what it did.

straightened out the hundred variant data files, and eliminated two older
variants that i believe were test variants used when developing hundred and
classical.

Wed Oct 29 18:32:29 GMT 1997

deleted configure stuff which wasn't complete.  will use autoconf later,
maybe.

Tue Nov  4 23:21:13 GMT 1997

added Mr Roust's patch to make the history command case insensitive.
