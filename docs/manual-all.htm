<h1><a name="introduction"></a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h1>
<h2><a name="aboutthejudge">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the Judge</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This is a guide to using the
Diplomacy&trade; Adjudicator, better known as the <span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">Judge</span>, an automated program for the
on-line play of the strategy game Diplomacy&trade;, published by
Hasbro, and many of its variants.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This manual only covers Judges using the
"<span class="BodyTextBoldChar">njudge</span>" software,
distributed from the Njudge Project (see <a href=
"#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>).&nbsp; These are not the only computer
adjudicator programs in existence; you can get information about
others from the sources listed below.&nbsp; You can also play
Diplomacy on-line through human adjudicators, or by postal mail,
or even (believe it or not!) face-to-face.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Diplomacy played via e-mail has existed
for almost as long as e-mail has been available to the private
consumer. There are several groups, such as the AOL Diplomacy
group, the well-regarded CompuServe Diplomacy group, and the
Cat23 group that have organized to run games over the web not
using the Judge system. But it is the Judge system that defines a
good portion of the Internet hobby, and has probably influenced
more of its development than anything else.&nbsp; (There is also a
system called the "<span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">DPJudge</span>", which has a WWW interface and
uses different software than the Ken Lowe judges, although it is
an outgrowth of the email Judge system.&nbsp; This manual does not
cover the DPJudge.)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The initial Judge code was written by Ken
Lowe in the late 1980s as a project to test his understanding of
the C programming language. The code has since been and continues
to be improved upon by the hard work of several different
programmers. Ken Lowe also set up and acted as judgekeeper for
the first Judge, USWA. USWA carried the hobby for several years
assisted by one or two other Judges, until it folded, causing
concern that the Judge hobby would die with it. Fortunately,
though, other hobbyists came through and set up Judges. At this
writing, there are over a dozen public judges in operation
world-wide, including several for non-English-speaking
players.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Each Judge is operated independently by a
volunteer administrator, known as the <span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">Judgekeeper</span>, and is identified by a
four-letter code (such as "USWA" in the previous paragraph).&nbsp; At
the moment, each Judge is a completely autonomous system. Users
must register with each Judge separately, and communicate with
each Judge separately. In particular, different Judges may be
running different versions of the <span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">njudge</span> software, so commands that work
on one Judge will not necessarily work on all others.&nbsp; Where
possible, this manual will indicate the software version in which
each command was introduced.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, using the Judge requires some
knowledge of the rules of Diplomacy.&nbsp; The Diplomacy rules
themselves are copyrighted by Hasbro, and are available (at this
writing) at <a href=
"http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF">http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF</a>.&nbsp;
However, this manual does not cover either the rules or the
strategy of Diplomacy.</p>
<h2><a name="aboutthismanual">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About this Manual</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This document is called the User's Manual
because it is designed for users, not for system administrators.&nbsp;
This manual is intended as a useful reference for anyone who
masters, plays in, or observes games on a Judge.&nbsp; However, new
users may find it easier to start with the introductory Guide to
the Judge, available by sending the command "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#GET">GET</a> GUIDE</span>" in a
message to the Judge.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The purpose of this manual is to list all
the commands that users may send to the Judge, provide examples
of proper and improper usage of the commands, and explain what
kinds of errors may occur and how to fix them.&nbsp; It is <i>not</i>
a guide to how to play the game of Diplomacy.&nbsp; <u><a href=
"#wheretofind">Section 1.3</a></u> lists many useful resources
for players on strategy, tactics, variants, and other
game-related information.</p>
<h3><a name="howinformationis">1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Information Is
Presented In This Manual</a></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The following chapters of this manual
include examples of commands to the Judge.&nbsp; To make the examples
clearer, they will always be displayed in a distinctive style.&nbsp;
Commands to send to the Judge will appear like this:</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1">GET filename</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Words shown in ALL CAPS, like "<span
class="QuotedKeywords">GET</span>" in the example above, are
<span class="BodyTextBoldChar">keywords</span> that should be
typed exactly as they appear.&nbsp; Words shown in lower case, like
"<span class="QuotedKeywords">filename</span>" in the example,
are placeholders that you replace with specific information (in
this example, the name of a file you want the Judge to send
you).&nbsp; The use of upper and lower case in these examples is only
for the purpose of distinguishing between keywords and
non-keywords; the actual commands can be typed in either upper-
or lower-case (with one exception; see <a href=
"#thedeadlinesystem">section 5.1</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Also, the Judge generally ignores spacing
between keywords, so, for instance, "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET&nbsp;NOWAIT</span>" works just as well as "<span
class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET&nbsp;NO&nbsp;WAIT</a></span>"
or even "<span class="QuotedKeywords">SETNOWAIT</span>".&nbsp; (But
inserting spaces inside a keyword, like "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET&nbsp;NOW AIT</span>", will cause an error!)&nbsp; This
was not always true on versions before 1.4.0, so if a multi-word
command that looks right, like "<span class="QuotedKeywords"><a
href="#IAMALSO">I AM ALSO</a></span>", causes a mysterious error
message, try the same command without spaces (<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">IAMALSO</span>) and see if it works that
way.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Items in square brackets are optional.
Words separated by vertical bars (|) indicate a choice of one of
the words. Again, these symbols are only shown to explain the
proper syntax.&nbsp; Users do not type in the square brackets or
vertical bars!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most command options are
self-explanatory.&nbsp; "<span class="QuotedKeywords">name</span>"
means the name of a game, which must be no more than 8
alphanumeric characters.&nbsp; "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">email</span>" means a valid email address.&nbsp;
"<span class="QuotedKeywords">power</span>" means the name (not
just the first letter) of one of the powers in the game, which
depends on the variant being played.&nbsp; The letter "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">p</span>" will be used where the initial of a
power is required.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">Caution:</span>&nbsp; whenever any setting is
described in this manual as the "default," that means only that
it is set that way in the software as provided from <a href=
"http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a> &ndash;
however, any Judgekeeper can change the default for games created
on his system, and Masters can change those defaults for
individual games.&nbsp; When in doubt, check the game listing (see
<span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#LIST">LIST</a></span>, <a
href="#gameinformationcommands">section 3.4</a>) to see what
settings are actually in effect.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A number in braces {like this} in the
right-hand margin after the command definition indicates the
first Judge version number in which the command appeared.&nbsp; If
this number is absent, then the command is believed to be
available in all currently used Judge versions (although this has
not been verified).&nbsp; [Note: some commands marked as version
{0.8.9} may actually have been introduced in versions 0.8.8 or
0.8.7, but this makes no real difference since no public Judge is
running either of those two versions at this time.]&nbsp; There are
also a few Judges running customized software not based on the
<span class="BodyTextBoldChar">njudge</span> code; these Judges
are unlikely to accept the commands shown with a version number
in this Manual. To find which Judges are running which versions
of the software, see <a href=
"http://gem.win.co.nz/judge/judgevers.html">http://gem.win.co.nz/judge/judgevers.html</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Examples that illustrate an entire email
communication with the Judge will be shown as illustrated below,
but will not follow the upper- and lower-case convention
discussed above:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">To: usxx@judgesite.com<br>
Subject: Help Me Please<br>
<br>
sign on rhappy password<br>
press to m<br>
Please help me!&nbsp; I don't know what I'm doing!<br>
endpress<br>
sign off</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, examples of responses from the
Judge will be shown as in the following illustration (most mail
headers have been omitted in the interest of clarity):</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="JudgeExample">From: &lt;usxx@judgesite.com&gt;<br>

<h3><a name="terminology">1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Terminology</a></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Here are a few commonly-used terms that
you should be familiar with:</p>
<p class="Hanging2"><b>Judge</b> &ndash; The Diplomacy
adjudicator computer program.</p>
<p class="Hanging2"><b>Judgekeeper</b> (also "JK" or
"administrator") &ndash; A human being who administers the Judge
software.</p>
<p class="Hanging2"><b>Master</b>&nbsp; (also "Gamemaster" or "GM")
&ndash; A human being, not necessarily the same person as the
Judgekeeper, who is in charge of a particular game being played
on the Judge.</p>
<p class="Hanging2"><b>Observer</b> &ndash; A person who is not
playing in a game, but who receives the game reports and, in some
cases, may be able to communicate with the players through the
Judge.</p>
<p class="Hanging2"><b>Player</b> &ndash; A person who is
participating in a game being run on the Judge.</p>
<p class="Hanging2"><b>Power</b> &ndash; One of the positions (7
in a standard game) played in a game being run on the Judge.&nbsp;
Please note that "power" identifies the position being played,
while "player" identifies the individual playing that
position.</p>

<h1><a name="introductiontothe">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction to the
Judge</a></h1>
<h2><a name="quickstartfor">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick Start for New
Users</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If you have never used the Judge before,
don't worry &ndash; you don't have to read this entire Manual
before you start playing.&nbsp; However, there are some basics you
need to understand.&nbsp; This Manual is designed more as a reference
than as a tutorial; you might find it easier to start with a page
designed for new players.&nbsp; Check the links at <a href=
"http://devel.diplom.org/Online/judge.html">http://www.diplom.org/Online/judge.html</a>.&nbsp;
But, if you insist on reading ahead, here are the suggested key
sections:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListBullet">Read sections <a href=
"#aboutthejudge">1.1</a>, <a href=
"#communicatingwiththe">2.2</a>, <a href="#whatdoi">2.3</a>, and
<a href="#thesinglemost">3.1</a> so that you understand what the
Judge is, what it does, and what it doesn't do.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read <a href="#wheretofind">section
1.3</a> and take a look at the various resources listed there.&nbsp;
Especially, check out the Judge Openings List and the Game Queue
page, if you want to find a game that you can join quickly.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read about the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#REGISTEREND">REGISTER</a></span>
command in <a href="#playerinformationand">section 3.3</a>.&nbsp;
Then, when you are ready to play, you can register on the Judge
that is hosting your game.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read about the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> command in
<a href="#creatingobservingand">section 4</a>.&nbsp; You will need to
use this to join a game.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">If you are joining a new game, rather than
taking over a replacement position, then you will probably want
to use the <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SETPREFERENCE">SET PREFERENCE</a></span> command in <a href=
"#generalcommands">section 7.1</a>.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read <a href="#thedeadlinesystem">section
5.1</a> so that you understand how deadlines are set, and why it
is important to pay attention to them.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">If you have played Diplomacy face-to-face
or in other settings, you probably already know how to write your
orders, but you might want to review <a href=
"#moveretreatand">section 6.1</a> to see what formats the Judge
will accept.&nbsp; You should definitely read <a href=
"#convoyroutesmust">section 6.2</a>, too, because sooner or later
you are going to be involved in a convoy order.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Finally, skim through <a href=
"#otherplayercommands">section 7</a> to see other commands that
you might need to use during a game.&nbsp; The most important ones to
understand are <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a></span>, <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a
href="#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a></span>, and the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#PRESS">PRESS</a></span> commands in <a
href="#presscommands">section 7.4</a>.&nbsp; Don't worry about "color
options" and "fake options" at this point; just read the basics
about how to send a press message to one or more other players,
including the "delivery options" section.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, the Judge itself provides a more
extensive guide for new users.&nbsp; Send an e-mail message to your
favorite Judge (running version 1.4.0 or higher) containing the
line "<span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#GET">GET</a>
GUIDE</span>" in the body.</p>
<h2><a name="communicatingwiththe">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicating with the
Judge</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Judge is an <span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">e-mail based</span> system.&nbsp; All
communications to and from the Judge are sent by e-mail.&nbsp; There
is no direct WWW access to a Judge, although Judge information
can be retrieved and viewed through several WWW sites.&nbsp; In order
to use a Judge, therefore, you must have e-mail access and you
must obtain the e-mail address of a Judge (see <a href=
"#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It is <i>highly</i> <i>recommended</i>
that you use a mail program or system that allows you to send
plain-text messages (also known as ASCII or Unformatted Text in
some software), as the Judge cannot process any messages that
contain HTML tags, MIME encoding, or other non-text commands.&nbsp;
However, most problems with formatted mail can be avoided by
religious use of the <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SIGNOFF">SIGN OFF</a></span> command (see <a href=
"#thesinglemost">section 3.1</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the Judge is functioning correctly, it
should send a reply to every e-mail message sent to it.&nbsp; The
reply is ordinarily sent to the address found in the <i>last</i>
Reply-to: header contained in the received mail message.&nbsp; Usually
this will be the same address that your message was sent from,
but some users may wish to receive the Judge replies at a
different address.&nbsp; You may be able to change your Reply-to
address using your mail software; alternatively, however, you can
simply type a return address at the beginning of your message,
using the following format:</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1">REPLY-TO: username@domain.tld</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If you are getting unwanted duplicate
replies from the Judge, see <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SETADDRESS">SET ADDRESS</a></span> in <a href=
"#generalcommands">section 7.1</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Commands to the Judge are entered in the
body of the mail message.&nbsp; The Judge does not process the subject
line, but does echo it back in its reply so that you can easily
tell which reply corresponds to which outgoing message.</p>
<h2><a name="whatdoi">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Do I Do If the Judge is
Down?</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yes, it does happen sometimes:&nbsp; you send a
message to the Judge, and no reply comes back; or, a deadline
goes by but you receive no results, no late notice, nothing at
all.&nbsp; There can be a couple of explanations for this.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It could mean (a) the Judge is down, in
which case it will usually process your message when it comes
back up; (b) your mail didn't reach the Judge in the first place,
which could be due to a problem with your ISP or some
intermediate system in the Internet mail relay system; or (c) the
Judge did send you a message but you didn't receive it for one of
the reasons suggested in (b).&nbsp; Some "anti-spam" programs have
been known to falsely identify particular Judges as spam senders
and block mail messages from them without warning.&nbsp; If this
happens to you, you can either complain to your ISP or find
another ISP for sending and receiving email.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A good way to check whether the problem is
with your email or with the Judge is to view the Judge Openings
List (see <a href="#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>), which will
report the last time each Judge's listing was updated.&nbsp; If your
Judge's time is not about the same as all the others', then there
is something wrong with the Judge.&nbsp; At this point, the
Judgekeeper will already have been sent an email from the
Openings List alerting him to the problem, so there is no need
for you to contact him directly.&nbsp; You may also wish to check the
rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup to see if there is any announcement
about the Judge's status.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the Judge is down, <i>don't</i>
continue to send mail to it; wait until it responds to the
messages you have already sent.&nbsp; At best, sending repeated
messages will flood your inbox with a huge volume of replies when
the Judge revives, and may delay processing of games.&nbsp; At worst,
you may end up having the wrong commands recorded, because the
Judge may not receive your messages in the same order as you sent
them. &nbsp;The best thing to do is just wait until the Judge is
restored, even though this can be nerve-wracking for some
people.&nbsp; You may be recorded as "late" if a deadline expires
during the time the Judge is down, but any Master will surely
forgive such an offense, and if it is an isolated incident then
the effect on your dedication ratings will be minimal.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If you are a Master and the Judge goes
down for an extended period, it is usually best to wait until it
is restored before trying to "fix" any problems.&nbsp; If you send
commands to change deadlines, for example, the Judge may process
the pending turn before it gets to your <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SETDEADLINE">SET&nbsp;DEADLINE</a></span>
command, so that you could inadvertently change the deadline for
the <i>next</i> phase.&nbsp; One thing that you can do while the Judge
is down, however, is to send a <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a
href="#SET%20LIST">SET&nbsp;NO&nbsp;LIST</a></span> command if your game is
public.&nbsp; If the deadline and grace period should expire during
the outage, this will prevent the game from being listed
publicly, and prevent any of your players' positions from being
taken over by a replacement.&nbsp; Once the Judge is restored, you can
then set an appropriate new deadline.</p>
<h2><a name="dateformats">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date Formats</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Several Judge commands involve the use of
dates.&nbsp; The Judge accepts dates from users only in a few specific
formats.&nbsp; If you are using a Judge that has been modified to
accept non-English commands, you should check with the
Judgekeeper to determine whether the date strings have also been
changed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Dates may include one or more of the
following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListBullet">A weekday, which must be one of these
three-letter abbreviations:</li>
</ul>
<p class="PlainIndent1">SUN | MON | TUE | WED | THU | FRI |
SAT</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListBullet">A month, which must be one of these
three-letter abbreviations:</li>
</ul>
<p class="PlainIndent1">JAN | FEB | MAR | APR | MAY | JUN | JUL |
AUG | SEP | OCT | NOV | DEC</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListBullet">A day of the month (a number from 1 to 31,
inclusive), optionally followed by a comma;</li>
<li class="ListBullet">A four-digit year</li>
<li class="ListBullet">A numeric time using the 24-hour clock
format "hh:mm"</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In general, these elements may appear in
any order.&nbsp; So, for example, "<span class="QuotedKeywords">Jun
15 23:30</span>" and "<span
class="QuotedKeywords">23:30 15 Jun</span>" are equivalent (and,
for that matter, "<span class="QuotedKeywords">Jun 23:30
15</span>" works too, even though this syntax makes no sense to
humans).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the weekday is used, then the month and
numeric day may not be used.&nbsp; The weekday is converted into the
next date (after the current date) that falls on that day of the
week.&nbsp; So, if today is a Tuesday, "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">Tue</span>" refers to the day one week from
today.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If no year is specified, the current year
is assumed <i>unless</i> the month specified is earlier than the
current month and is no more than six months away; in that case,
the following year will be assumed.&nbsp; So, if it is currently
December, "<span class="QuotedKeywords">10&nbsp;Jan</span>" is assumed
to refer to the next year; but if it is currently February, the
same date will be assumed to refer to a date in the past.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If a day number but no month is specified,
the next date with that day number will be used.&nbsp; If today is
June 1, then "<span class="QuotedKeywords">15</span>" without any
month will be assumed to refer to June 15.&nbsp; If today is June 20,
however, the same command will refer to July 15.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If a month but no day is specified, the
first day of the month will be assumed, unless it is the current
month, in which case the current day will be assumed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If no weekday, month, day, or year is
specified, the current day is assumed (except for the <span
class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></span>
command, see <a href="#gameinformationcommands">section
3.4</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If no time is specified, a default time
will be assumed, which depends on the specific command being
executed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All dates and times are based on the clock
settings of the computer system that the Judge is running on;
usually, this is the local time zone of the Judge system.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Dates are used in the commands: <a href=
"#HISTORY"><span class="QuotedKeywords">HISTORY</span></a>, <a
href="#SETABSENCE"><span class="QuotedKeywords">SET
ABSENCE</span></a>, <a href="#SETDEADLINE"><span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET DEADLINE</span></a>, <a href=

<h1><a name="userregistrationand">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Registration and
Administrative Commands</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Before you can join or observe a game on a
Judge, you must be a registered user of the Judge.&nbsp; There are a
few commands, however, that anyone can use even if they are not
registered (one of these, of course, is the command to register
yourself).</p>
<h2><a name="thesinglemost">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Single Most Important
Judge Command</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In this Manual, the last shall be first;
thus, we begin with the <i>last</i> command that should appear in
every message you send to a Judge:</p>
<p class="CommandTermLast"><a name="SIGNOFF">SIGN OFF</a></p>
<p class="Indent1">Indicates the end of commands in a message to
the Judge.&nbsp; This prevents your signature file (or taglines
inserted by your e-mail provider) from being interpreted as
orders and/or being sent out as part of a press message.&nbsp; If this
command is not used, the Judge will attempt to parse all
characters in the mail message until the end of the file is
reached.&nbsp; This can result in your moves being rejected due to
errors, or worse:&nbsp; too many players to count have revealed their
passwords because they forgot to put <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#ENDPRESS">ENDPRESS</a></span> and
<span class="QuotedKeywords">SIGN OFF</span> after their press,
and also forgot to set their mail program to send <a href=
"#communicatingwiththe">plain text</a> messages.&nbsp; Their mail
programs then attached a nicely formatted HTML copy of their
entire message, including the <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a
href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> command complete with password,
after the plain text version, which the Judge duly treated as
part of their press!&nbsp; You should develop a habit of including
this line at the end of <i>every</i> message you send to the
Judge.</p>
<h2><a name="userhelpcommands">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Help
Commands</a></h2>
<p class="CommandTerm"><a name="GET">GET file</a></p>
<p class="CommandTermLast"><a name="SEND">SEND [ME] file</a></p>
<p class="Indent1">The Judge will send the file 'file' by return
mail.&nbsp; In the rest of this document, single quotes will be used
to signify the names of help files.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Get file 'flist' for a complete list of
available files.&nbsp; Get file 'info' for a description of the more
important files.&nbsp; Both of these files are included in the new
user package, which you can retrieve with the next command:</p>
<p class="CommandTermLast"><a name="GETPACKAGE">GET

<p class="Indent1">Get the new user package of files.&nbsp; These

<p class="Indent1">Retrieve (by email) history information for

that an observer would have seen had he been signed on for the

<p class="Indent2">This form retrieves the history information
for the specified game ("name") for the specified time period (in

<p class="Indent2">To get the earliest part of the history (or

Dedication (or, Get Your Orders in on Time!)</a></h1>
<h2><a name="thedeadlinesystem">5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Deadline
System</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Judge system administers deadlines for
all games.&nbsp; House rules normally require that you submit orders
before the deadline <span class="BodyTextBoldChar">whether you
are finished with negotiations or not!&nbsp;</span> It is considered
unsportsmanlike, and possible grounds for expulsion, to <span
class="BodyTextBoldChar">deliberately</span> submit orders late
for any reason, or to continue negotiating past the deadline
(unless your orders are already submitted).&nbsp; On the other hand,
illnesses, email interruptions, and other unintended reasons for
missing deadlines do occur, and so the Judge system provides a
grace period for these events.&nbsp; If you miss both the deadline and
the grace period, your position may become abandoned and taken
over by another player.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Deadlines are always determined by the
Judge's "local" time, which is simply whatever time the system
clock says on the computer that is running the Judge software.&nbsp;
The deadline notices included in Judge messages will specify the
"local" time zone, in hours before or after GMT.&nbsp; For
example:</p>
<div style=
'border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt; margin-left:.5in;margin-right:.5in'>
<p class="JudgeExample">The next phase of 'fubar' will be
Adjustments for Winter of 1908.<br>
The deadline for orders will be Mon Nov 17 2003 23:31:03
-0600.</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This particular Judge's local time zone,
as indicated by the "-0600", is six hours earlier than GMT
(<i>i.e.</i>, U.S. Central Standard Time).&nbsp; If you don't want to
mess around with converting this to your own local time zone, do
what the author does &ndash; go to <a href=
"http://www.floc.net/observer.py?page=login_screen">http://www.floc.net/observer.py?page=login_screen</a>
and create your own customized page, which will list the
deadlines for all your games in your local time zone (after you
set up your page and tell it which time zone to use).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Unless otherwise specified, orders will be
processed on the following schedule.&nbsp; These default settings may
be changed by the Judgekeeper, and may be further changed for
individual games by a Master, or by any player in an unmoderated
game, so be sure to check your own game's listing.</p>
<pre>
Move    clock 1410 min 12.00 next  71.00 grace 167.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
Retreat clock   -1 min  0.00 next  23.00 grace  71.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
Adjust  clock   -1 min  0.00 next  23.00 grace  71.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
</pre>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Each value goes with the keyword
<i>before</i> it, not after.&nbsp; (So the first line means "clock
1410"; "min 12.00"; etc. &ndash; <i>not</i> "clock 1410 min" or
"12.00 next".)&nbsp; The meanings of the various settings are as
follows:</p>
<p class="Indent1Hang"><b>clock</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; If non-negative, indicates
the minutes past midnight to which the new deadline will be set.&nbsp;
1410 is eleven thirty pm.&nbsp; If negative, this parameter is
ignored, and the new deadline is set at exactly "next" hours
after the time the previous phase was processed.</p>
<p class="Indent1Hang"><b>min</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indicates the minimum
number of hours that can elapse between the previous phase and
the new phase. Thus, in the above example, there will be at least
12 hours after a build or retreat phase before the movement
orders will be processed. This parameter has no real use other
than to prevent a runaway situation if all of the powers in a
game were to go CD.</p>
<p class="Indent1Hang"><b>next</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp; Indicates the number of
hours after the previous phase is processed that the new deadline
will be set. This may be increased to fit into the values of the
'clock' and/or 'days' parameters. In the default case, movement
orders are three days after the previous phase. However, because
of the "clock" setting, the deadline will be advanced to 11:30
p.m. on the third day; and, because of the "days" setting, if the
third day falls on a weekend it will slide to Monday.
(<b>Note</b>: the "next" interval is specified as 71 hours,
rather than 72, because of the interaction between "next" and
"clock". The Judge does not process seasons instantaneously. If
the Spring 1901 phase is processed, for example, at 11:35 pm
Monday, then a "next 72.0" setting would require the next
deadline to be at 11:35 pm Thursday; but, since "clock" requires
that the deadline be exactly at 11:30 pm, this would push the
deadline forward to Friday.)</p>
<p class="Indent2">In any event, the next deadline should never
be earlier than the deadline from the most recently processed
phase (thus, for example, if the moderator manually extends the
current deadline for two weeks to allow for a player absence, but
then the turn is processed because the absent player was nice
enough to submit orders before he left, the next deadline will
still be approximately two weeks away). The only exception to
this is if the moderator manually resets the deadline to an
earlier time.</p>
<p class="Indent1Hang"><b>grace</b>: Indicates the number of
hours the adjudicator will wait after the deadline expires if not
everyone has gotten their orders in yet.&nbsp; In the default case, a
grace period of one week after the initial deadline is allowed.
When the deadline comes up, a reminder message will be sent to
everyone who hasn't gotten their orders in and a notice will be
sent to the other players and observers in the game indicating
who is late. Another reminder will be sent to the late parties,
and a notice to all other participants, every day.</p>
<p class="Indent2">If the game is set "NoNMR" (the default), the
Judge will wait for orders until the end of the grace period.
Then, a notice will be sent to all players and observers in that
game indicating that the late power has been abandoned. Abandoned
powers may be taken over by anyone not already playing a power in
the game merely by signing on with any password. No orders will
be processed until the late power returns or is taken over.</p>
<p class="Indent2">If the game is uses the NMR setting, the power
will be deemed abandoned if orders have not been received by 24
hours <i>before</i> the end of the grace period. If you are
running an NMR game, therefore, your grace periods must be at
least 24 hours and normally should be at least 48. At the end of
the grace period, if complete orders still have not been
received, either from the original player or a replacement, the
power will be declared in "Civil Disorder" and the phase will be
processed with incomplete orders. On subsequent phases powers
marked CD will not be considered when deciding whether the
deadline should slide. When a valid <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> is
received, the CD and/or abandoned status will be cleared.</p>
<p class="Indent2">As with the deadline, the program should never
set a grace period that is earlier than the grace period from the
last processed season, although a moderator can change this
manually.</p>
<p class="Indent1Hang"><b>delay</b>: Indicates the number of
hours after the last required orders have been received before
the orders will be processed. The default is 0.5 hours, so that
if all powers get their orders in before the deadline, the orders
will be processed thirty minutes later. This gives people a
little time to change their mind after orders are submitted.</p>
<p class="Indent1Hang"><b>days</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies which days of
the week are valid for the setting of the initial deadline. An
uppercase letter indicates that that day of the week is okay. If
the letter is lowercase, then the deadline is delayed until after
noon. A dash indicates that the deadline cannot fall on that day
of the week. Unless the "StrictGrace" flag has been set, the
grace period also will be extended to a day that is valid for the
initial deadline. <b>Warning</b>: this parameter is an exception
to the general rule that adjudicator commands are not
case-sensitive!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These parameters can be changed by a
moderator using the <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET</span>
command. For example:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">SET MOVES NEXT 48.0 DELAY 1.0<br>
SET BUILDS DELAY 1.0</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These commands will (a) set the default
move deadline to (at least) 48 hours after the previous phase was
processed, and (b) require a one-hour delay after the last player
submits (timely) move and build orders before the turn can be
processed. These commands will not change the deadlines for the
currently pending phase.&nbsp; See <a href=
"#deadlinerelatedsettings">section 8.6</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, a moderator can use the
following commands to override the standard deadline settings for
the current phase only: <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SETDEADLINE">SET DEADLINE</a>; <a href="#SETGRACE">SET
GRACE</a>; <a href="#SETSTART">SET START</a></span>.&nbsp; See <a
href="#deadlinerelatedsettings">section 8.6</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Orders can be sent in any time before the
deadline. If multiple movement orders are received for the same
unit, the most recent one received will override the earlier one.
Attempting to build or remove too many units during the
adjustment phase will cause the earliest received build/remove
requests to be ignored. Thus you can send in preliminary movement
or adjustment orders immediately and then send in revised orders
after you change your mind from diplomatic talks. Beware, though,
that if everyone gets their orders in before the deadline, the
orders may be processed before you have a chance to get your
revised orders in.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If you include a <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a></span> command
with your orders, you can avoid having your orders processed
before the deadline. When you've decided that your orders are
final, you can send in a message with a <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET NO WAIT</span> command to allow the orders
to be processed as soon as the delay period expires and everyone
else has their orders in. Remember that <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a></span> is
cleared when the orders are processed, so you have to explicitly
set it again (if you want it) for each phase.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the reply mail to any order indicates
that there was an error or you have a unit that you did not
supply an order for or you didn't explicitly specify all your
builds, remove or retreats, the flag indicating that your orders
have been received will not be set. All builds must be specified
or explicitly <span class="QuotedKeywords">WAIVE</span>'d before
the adjudicator will consider your build orders complete, unless
it is impossible to build all units (<i>e.g.</i>, five supply
centers taken in a single year or no vacant home centers). An
error free set of orders will be required to set the "has
submitted orders" status. If no error free orders have been
received by the time the grace period expires in an "NMR" game,
the partial orders will be processed and the CD status will be
set for your power. See the discussion on grace periods above for
more info on what happens when you miss a deadline and taking
over abandoned powers.</p>
<h2><a name="dedicationsystems">5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dedication
Systems</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">"Dedication" refers to a player's history
of submitting moves on time and playing each position out to the
bitter end.&nbsp; Doing this is <span class=
"BodyTextBoldChar">good</span>; sending orders late and
abandoning your position when the game is going against you are
<span class="BodyTextBoldChar">bad</span>.&nbsp; Playing Diplomacy is
a group effort and can take quite a while to complete (as you
know if you've played face-to-face); nobody wants to play with
someone who just disappears in the middle of the game.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Judge tracks player dedication in
three ways. System (1) tracks all games ever played on the Judge
(unless the Judgekeeper has reset the data files).&nbsp; Systems (2)
and (3), which are newer, only track turns played since they were
installed on the Judge (which varies by Judge, but was no earlier
than 2002).</p>
<p class="HangingIndent">(1) The original dedication system,
which has some flaws but is being maintained for continuity, is
based on a point system.&nbsp; The default values, which like all
Judge defaults can be changed by a particular Judgekeeper, are as
follows:</p>
<p class="Indent2">+3 points for getting your orders in on
time.</p>
<p class="Indent2">-1 point for each "deadline missed" reminder
the judge sends you.</p>
<p class="Indent2">-50 points for becoming abandoned.</p>
<p class="Indent2">-100 points for missing the grace period and
going CD.</p>
<p class="Indent1">There is no penalty for resigning before a
deadline, if you submit complete orders <i>before</i> you
resign.&nbsp; However, you will continue to receive the -1 point
penalty every day that your power remains abandoned after the
deadline.&nbsp; If your power goes CD after you've resigned without
anyone else taking the power over, you will receive the CD
penalty as well (this is to discourage you from resigning when
you're down to a few units which could be used to affect the
final outcome of the game, but you've just lost interest).</p>
<p class="HangingIndent">(2)&nbsp; The "ontime ratio" system. In this
system players are rated based on what percentage of their total
turns they have submitted on time. We use the following
formula:</p>
<pre>
               Turns Submitted Ontime
Rating  =  -----------------------------
                  Total turns due
</pre>
<p class="Indent1">Therefore each player has a rating between 0.0
and 1.0, with higher rankings being better than lower ones.</p>
<p class="HangingIndent">(3) The "CD ratio" system, which
compares the number of times a player has gone into Civil
Disorder (<i>i.e.</i>, failed to submit complete orders by the
end of the grace period, regardless of whether the game was NMR
or not), to the number of games he has started. We use the
following formula:</p>
<pre>
                       Times in Civil Disorder
Rating =  ----------------------------------------------------
             Games started + abandoned positions taken over
</pre>
<p class="Indent1">Again ratings range from 0.0 to 1.0, but in
this case lower ratings (fewer missed grace periods) are
preferable.&nbsp; (Actually, a player who is really sloppy about
deadlines could theoretically achieve a ratio above 1.0, but we
won't dwell on such an unhappy possibility.)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">GMs or others creating games can restrict
who is eligible to sign on to the game based on dedication
ratings, using the commands <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SETDEDICATION">SET DEDICATION</a></span>, <span class=

<h1><a name="enteringorders">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering Orders</a></h1>
<h2><a name="moveretreatand">6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move, Retreat, and
Adjustment Orders for the Current Phase</a></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Following a <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> command, a
player may submit orders for his power for the current phase
simply by typing those orders in the body of the mail message.
Multiple orders can be entered on one line by separating them
with commas or semicolons.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most orders can be written the same way
they are customarily written in face-to-face games, using the
abbreviations shown in the Diplomacy rulebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Indent1"><b>Warning:</b> the syntax for convoys is
different than in the standard Diplomacy rules.&nbsp; See <a href=
"#convoyroutesmust">section 6.2</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Indent1"><b>Warning</b>: if you want to support a fleet
moving to a bi-coastal province, you <i>must</i> specify the
coast to which the fleet is moving.&nbsp; If you omit the coast in a
support <i>or</i> move order for a fleet that can move to either
coast of a province, the Judge will arbitrarily add a coast to
the order (namely, the first one on its list).&nbsp; This may lead to
unintended results!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Also, unlike standard Diplomacy, the Judge
does not require or permit you to specify the power that owns a
unit you are supporting or convoying.&nbsp; (So you would just write
"A Ven S A Tri" rather than "A Ven S Austrian A Tri".)&nbsp; And,
again unlike standard Diplomacy, the Judge will not accept orders
that are impossible or badly-written (like A Par-Mun, or F Nth S
Philadelphia-Boston), or for units that you don't actually
control.&nbsp; Instead, erroneous orders will raise the "error flag,"
and orders will not be processed until the errors are
corrected.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If you have submitted any orders for the
current phase, the Judge will list these orders in its reply to
every message you send to it, until the phase is processed.&nbsp; It
is <i>highly</i> recommended that players check the orders in the
Judge reply to make sure their orders have been parsed as they
intended, and to make sure that all units have been ordered!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The following is an exhaustive list of the
order syntax recognized by the Judge.&nbsp; Some of these order
formats may only be used in variant games.&nbsp; Items in [square

<p class="Indent1"><b>Note</b>: "wing" units, "proxy" orders and
"transform" orders can only be used if the moderator has enabled
the corresponding variant setting.&nbsp; The "maintain" order is used
only if the <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET ANY DISBAND</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Province names can be abbreviated or can
be spelled out.&nbsp; Valid abbreviations can be found in the 'map'
file for the variant you are playing (use the command "<span

"<span class="QuotedKeywords">GET map.xxx</span>" for variant map
"xxx").&nbsp; When including a <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">&lt;coast&gt;</span>, you can of course replace
"north" or "n" with another direction as appropriate.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Here are some examples of valid orders
(assuming that the player actually controls the units given in
the orders):</p>
<p class="Indent1">Movement phase orders:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">A Ber -&gt; Kie<br>
A Ser m Rum<br>
Lon-Nth<br>
F Kiel moves to Berlin<br>
Par H<br>
F Rome Stands<br>
A MUN S F KIE-BER<br>
A Brest supports Paris<br>
F Sev S A Ser M Rum</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent2">Note that, as in the example "Lon-Nth", it is
not necessary to specify the unit type, but since Nth is a sea
space the order will be rejected if the unit in Lon is not
actually a fleet.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Retreat phase orders:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">F Kiel m Den<br>
A Rum-Bul<br>
Par -&gt; Pic<br>
Mun disbands</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent2">As these examples show, retreats are written
exactly like movement orders, except when you are disbanding a
unit.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Adjustment phase orders:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">build A Lon<br>
F StP/sc<br>
remove A Tun</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent2">The order for "F StP/sc" will be interpreted
as either a build or a removal, depend<span class=
"Indent2Char">i</span>ng on whether the power has more supply
centers than units, or vice versa.&nbsp; <i>But</i> see <a href=
"#submittingordersfor">section 6.3</a> regarding phased
build/removal orders.&nbsp; In the case of a removal, the unit type is
also optional, so "<span class="QuotedKeywords">Tun</span>" would
be a valid removal order, too.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Note the difference between disband orders
in a retreat phase, and removal orders in an adjustment phase.&nbsp;
In a retreat phase, the word "disband" is required and comes
<i>after</i> the unit type and location; in an adjustment phase,
the word "disband" or "remove" is optional and, if used, comes
<i>before</i> the unit type and location.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Similarly, the syntax for transform orders
(<i>which are used only in variant games</i>) depends on whether
it is a movement or an adjustment phase.&nbsp; In a move phase, the
unit location comes first, followed by the transform command,
then the new unit type.&nbsp; In an adjustment phase, however, the
transform command comes first, followed by the <i>new</i> unit
type, then the location.&nbsp; Examples (assuming, in each case, that
the player currently has a fleet in Brest and an army in Spain,
and that the current game settings permit the desired
transformations):</p>
<p class="Indent1">Movement phase:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">F Brest transforms to Army</p>
<p class="Example">Spain trafo F (sc)</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent1">Adjustment phase:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">Transform A Brest<br>
trafo f spa/sc</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In both cases, the order will fail if the
player does not specify the <i>new</i> unit type (because this
command is supported in variants that recognize other unit types
besides armies and fleets); however, specifying the <i>old</i>
unit type is never required, and is not permitted in the
adjustment phase.&nbsp; The transformation of the army in Spain to a
fleet will also fail unless the player specifies which coast the
fleet is to be placed on.&nbsp; Finally, please note that while
transform orders can be abbreviated as "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">trafo</span>", they cannot be abbreviated as
"<span class="QuotedKeywords">t</span>" because that abbreviation
is reserved for convoy orders.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Revisions to orders can be sent in any
time before the phase is processed. Orders may be processed
before the deadline unless the <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a
href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a></span> command has been used (see <a
href="#deadlinerelatedcommands">section 7.2</a>).&nbsp; The last valid
order for a particular unit will be honored.&nbsp; For Adjustment
phases, if you submit more build orders than you can use, the
last one(s) received will be honored.&nbsp; If no valid order is
received for a particular unit in an NMR game, it will be listed
in the reports as "No order processed".</p>
<h2><a name="convoyroutesmust">6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convoy Routes Must Be

If <span class="QuotedKeywords">end_date</span> is before <span
class="QuotedKeywords">start_date</span>, the command will be
ignored. If <span class="QuotedKeywords">end_date</span> is
omitted, an absence period of 24 hours is assumed.&nbsp; If absences
are overlaid, they count as separate absences.&nbsp; However, Judge
versions 1.4.0 and higher will reject attempts to set overlapping
absences.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Observers and eliminated (inactive) players
cannot set absences.&nbsp; Masters can.</p>
<p class="Indent1"><span class="QuotedKeywords">SET NO
ABSENCE</span> cancels one pending absence period.&nbsp; The <span
class="QuotedKeywords">end_date</span> is ignored. The first
absence found that includes <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">start_date</span> is cancelled.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Setting an absence never extends the
<i>current</i> deadline; it only takes effect when a turn is
processed, if the <i>next</i> deadline using the normal settings
would fall after <span class="QuotedKeywords">start_date</span>.&nbsp;
A player who is going away needs to either submit their orders
for the phase that is pending at <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">start_date</span> before they leave, pick a
<span class="QuotedKeywords">start_date</span> that is early
enough so that this won't be a problem, or ask the Master to
extend the current deadline. (Understandably, Masters may be
unhappy if you choose the last option.)&nbsp; It is also recommended
(though not required) that <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">start_date</span> and <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">end_date</span> be days on which deadlines
normally fall; for example, in a weekdays-only game, setting an
absence to start or end on a Saturday or Sunday may yield
undesired results.</p>
<p class="Indent1"><span class="QuotedKeywords">Start_date</span>
and <span class="QuotedKeywords">end_date</span> may use any of
the date/time formats described in <a href=
"#quickstartfor">section 2.1</a>.&nbsp; Examples of valid date
formats:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">set absence Jan 1 to Jan 15<br>
set absence 24 Jun to 3 Jul<br>
set absence Sat to Tue</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent1">Note that the last example will not work if it
is sent on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, as the Judge will
interpret "Sat" as the following Saturday, and "Tue" as meaning
'this coming Tuesday', not 'Tuesday next week' as the player
seems to intend; the Judge will reject the absence because it
appears to end before it begins.&nbsp; It is therefore better in most
cases to specify the dates.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Only a maximum of three (3) absences can be
pending at any given time for a single player.&nbsp; Once an absence
expires, however, it is removed from memory and its "slot"
becomes available for another request.&nbsp; If you need to change a
previously-set absence, first <span class="QuotedKeywords">use
SET NO ABSENCE</span> to remove the old one, then use <span
class="QuotedKeywords">SET ABSENCE</span> to set the correct
dates.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will use up two of your slots.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Each absence request will generate an
informative message to the Master, and he will also see the
pending future absences every time he sends a message for the
game (along with pending orders).</p>
<p class="Indent1">If an absence request exceeds the game limit
(see command <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SETMAXABSENCE">SET MAX ABSENCE</a></span> in <a href=
"#deadlinerelatedsettings">section 8.6</a>), a message will be
sent to the Master who must manually activate the absence for it
to take effect.&nbsp; Generally, the Master should do this by using
the <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#BECOME">BECOME
power</a></span> command (see <a href=
"#masteronlycommands">section 8.2</a>) and setting the absence
for the player, as this allows the player to cancel or change the
absence later if desired.&nbsp; (Also, the Master, like each player,
has only three absence "slots," and might use them all up setting
absences for other players.)&nbsp; The <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">MAX ABSENCE</span> setting is ignored if the absence
is set by a Master, even using <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a
href="#BECOME">BECOME</a></span>.</p>

<p class="CommandTermLast">SET NO DRAW</p>
<p class="Indent1">Cast a vote in an automated draw.&nbsp; The <span
class="QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> option is only valid if
the game is set NoDIAS. Any draw vote, DIAS or NoDIAS, is good
for one phase only. All draw votes are cleared at the end of a
phase, so you need to cast your vote again every phase (if you
still want to agree to a draw).&nbsp; It is normally not necessary to
use <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET NO DRAW</span> unless you
change your mind in the middle of a phase, since no draw can be
passed without consent of all active players.</p>
<p class="Indent1">The term "DIAS" means "Draws Include All
Survivors". By default, all games are DIAS.&nbsp; The moderator can
change this with the <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET</span>
<span class="QuotedKeywords">NO DIAS</span> or <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET DIAS</span> commands.&nbsp; See <a href=
"#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a>.&nbsp; In a DIAS game, a
surviving player cannot be excluded from a draw.&nbsp; In a NoDIAS
game, a surviving player may give up his right to be included in
a draw.&nbsp; In either case, unanimous approval of surviving players
is required for a draw to be passed.</p>
<p class="Indent1">In a DIAS game, a player may cast his vote for
a draw by issuing the command <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET
DRAW</span>.&nbsp; He may withdraw earlier approval by issuing the
command <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET NO DRAW</span>.&nbsp; If at
any time all surviving players agree to a DIAS draw, the game
will be immediately terminated (without waiting for the next
deadline), and all participants in the game will be informed of
the result.</p>
<p class="Indent1">The situation for NoDIAS games is a bit more
complex. To vote for a NoDIAS draw, a player issues the command
<span class="QuotedKeywords">SET DRAW powerlist</span>, where
<span class="QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> is a list of the
identifiers for the powers he wishes included in the draw. When a
player gives approval to <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> and <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> includes his own power, he is
also implicitly approving any subset of <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> that also includes his power.
On the other hand, when a player gives approval to <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> and <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> does <i>not</i> include his own
power, he is implicitly approving any subset of <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span>, <i>and</i> any subset of <span
class="QuotedKeywords">powerlist</span> plus his own power.</p>
<p class="Indent1">For example, if Austria issued the command
<span class="QuotedKeywords">SET DRAW AEG</span>, he is approving the draws AEG, AG,
AE, or A. Note that by including himself in his draw list, he is
assuring that he cannot be excluded from a draw.&nbsp; If Austria
issues <span class="QuotedKeywords">SET DRAW A</span>, he is accepting <i>any</i> draw as
long as it includes him.&nbsp; If Austria issues <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET DRAW FT</span>, he is approving FT, F, T, AFT, AF,
AT, or A.</p>
<p class="Indent1">If, under these rules, more than one draw is
approved by all players, the draw including the most players
passes.</p>
<p class="Indent1">In a NoDIAS game, <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET NO DRAW</span> is equivalent to the command <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">SET DRAW x</span>, where x is the power issuing the
command. This means that the player will only accept a concession
to himself.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Here are a few examples of the NoDIAS draw
mechanism in action. The players listed are assumed to be the
only survivors.</p>

lieu of, other forms of press.</p>
<p class="Indent1">The press setting values listed above can also
be used by a moderator as command keywords, after the <span
class="QuotedKeywords">SET</span> command, to change the types of
allowable press.&nbsp; See <a href="#gameaccesssettings">section
8.4</a>. For example:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">&nbsp;SET GREY, PARTIAL FAKES BROADCAST</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent1">would mean that all press (except to or from
the Master) would appear to be a grey broadcast message, even if
it is actually sent to only one player.&nbsp; The commas are optional.
(The press settings that appear in the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#LIST">LIST</a></span> results will not
be in exactly the same format as shown above; for example, the
"Observers None" setting would appear as "No Observers".)</p>
<p class="Indent1">Note:&nbsp; If fake press is allowed in a game,
press to the Master will <i>not</i> be faked, and you will get
scolded if you try.</p>
<p class="Indent1">By default, games are "White, Partial Allowed,
No Fake, No PostalPress".</p>
<p class="Indent1">Options</p>
<p class="Indent2">The <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BROADCAST</span> command without options is
equivalent to "<span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS TO ALL</span>";
that is, the message will be sent to all players.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
using the <span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS</span> command
without any options will result in no message being sent.&nbsp; This
is to prevent accidental broadcasts, which can result in your
secret attack plans being sent to the entire game.&nbsp; Finally, if
<span class="QuotedKeywords">BROADCAST</span> <i>is</i> followed
by options, it is treated exactly the same as a <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">PRESS</span> command (so if, for some odd
reason, you wrote "<span class="QuotedKeywords">BROADCAST TO
G</span>", the message would go only to Germany and not to the
entire game).</p>
<p class="Indent1">(1) color-options</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1">WHITE | UNANONYMOUS | UNANONYMOUSLY</p>
<p class="Indent2">The message is sent out with your power and
return address specified.&nbsp; This is only necessary if white and
grey press are both allowed and grey is the default.&nbsp; This is the
most common use of press, and results in a message that looks
something like this:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="JudgeExample">Message from bismarck@berlin.net as
Germany to France in 'gamename':<br>
<br>
Greetings, neighbor.&nbsp; I do hope we will have peace between our
great countries, and that you will recognize the historic ties
between Alsace-Lorraine and the rest of Germany.<br>
<br>
Bismarck</p>
</div>
<p class="PlainIndent1">GREY | ANONYMOUS | ANONYMOUSLY</p>
<p class="Indent2">The message is sent out with no indication as
to the originator. This is only necessary if white and grey press
are both allowed and white is the default.&nbsp; Suppose France sends
the command "<span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS GREY TO
G</span>": then Germany will receive a message like the
following, with no indication that it came from France:</p>
<div style="ExampleBox">
<p class="JudgeExample">Message to Germany in 'gamename':<br>
<br>
My agents report that Russia is moving to Silesia.&nbsp; Be wary!<br>
<br>
Mata Hari</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent1">(2)&nbsp; delivery-options</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1CxSpFirst">TO list</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1CxSpLast">+list</p>
<p class="Indent2">&nbsp;The message will be sent only to the list of
powers specified.&nbsp; The list consists of the single character
identifier for the powers combined as a single word.&nbsp; Thus
"PRESS&nbsp;TO&nbsp;FRG" would send the message to France, Russia and
Germany in a Standard game.&nbsp; In most variants the first letter of
the power is usually the character (but not always; for instance,
India in the Youngstown variant is 'N' because 'I' is used to
represent Italy).&nbsp; The special characters 'O' and 'M' are
interpreted Observer and Master respectively in all variants.</p>
<p class="Indent2"><b>Warning:</b> only use initials in the list;
you may be dismayed if you type "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">PRESS&nbsp;TO&nbsp;Turkey</span>", because the Judge will
try to interpret "Turkey" as a list of initials.&nbsp; In a Standard
game, this will result in an error message, because U, K, and Y
are not valid power initials; in some variants, however, you
might end up sending a message to six players!</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1CxSpFirst">TO ALL BUT list</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1CxSpLast">-list</p>
<p class="Indent2">The message is sent to all powers
<i>except</i> those specified in the list.&nbsp; Note that since all
press that can be read by Observers is archived in the game's
history file, a message sent "<span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS
TO ALL BUT R</span>" (for example) will be available to Russia by
means of the History command.&nbsp; Use "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">PRESS TO ALL BUT RO</span>" to be sure that the
message isn't archived.&nbsp; Also, remember that a Master is able (if
he wants) to read all press regardless of how it is
addressed.</p>
<p class="Indent1">(3)&nbsp; Fake options</p>
<p class="Indent2">The Judge's "fake press" options are not often
used, and as a result are not widely understood.&nbsp; "Fake" press is
press with a forged "To" line; you cannot use these options to
make it look like press came <i>from</i> someone else.&nbsp; To hide
the origin of press, you have to use the "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">GREY</span>" color-option.</p>
<p class="Indent2">The main use of "fake" press is to try to fool
certain players into thinking that other players did or did not
see your message when that is not the case.&nbsp; For example, you
could send a partial press only to one player but make it look
like a broadcast; or you could send a partial press to France and
Germany addressed only to France (so that France doesn't know
Germany also saw it).&nbsp; Some combinations of these options will
work but not make much sense; for instance, if you send a message
to Italy and it says "Press to Turkey" at the top, he will
obviously know it is faked.</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1">[NO] FAKE [BROADCAST]</p>
<p class="Indent2">The message is faked (or not) as a broadcast
message to all players.&nbsp; The "<span class="QuotedKeywords">NO
FAKE</span>" option is needed only in a game that has the
"Partial Fake Broadcast by Default" setting.</p>
<p class="PlainIndent1">FAKE [PARTIAL] delivery-option</p>
<p class="Indent2">The message is faked as going to the set of
people specified even though it may be a broadcast message or be
a message sent to an alternate set of people.&nbsp; The
delivery-option may be any of the forms listed in the previous
section.</p>
<p class="Indent2">For fake press, you must first specify the
real recipients of the press (if not specified, a broadcast is
assumed), then put the word "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">FAKE</span>" followed by the addressees to be
named in the message header (again, if not specified, it is
assumed that a fake broadcast is intended).&nbsp; For example, "<span
class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS FAKE TO FRG</span>" will be
interpreted as a broadcast message to everyone that is faked as
going to France, Russia and Germany rather than a message going
to France, Russia and Germany that is faked as a broadcast.&nbsp; If
the latter was intended the keyword "<span class=
"QuotedKeywords">FAKE</span>" can be placed at the end as in
"<span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS TO FRG FAKE</span>" or the
keyword "<span class="QuotedKeywords">BROADCAST</span>" must be
specified as in "<span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS FAKE
BROADCAST TO FRG</span>". As an example in a Grey press game
allowing fake broadcasts, Italy might start off the game by
posting the following press message:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">PRESS TO ALL BUT G FAKE BROADCAST<br>
This is Germany and I think you all are wimps.&nbsp; I bet I can win
even if you all gang up against me.<br>
<br>
-Kaiser Bill<br>
ENDPRESS</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent2">Everyone but Germany would get a press message
from the Judge that looks like this:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="JudgeExample">Broadcast message in 'gamename':<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is Germany and I think you all are wimps.&nbsp; I bet I can win
even if you all gang up against me.<br>
<br>
-Kaiser Bill</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent2">[Remember, however, that if Germany thinks to
issue a <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></span> command, he can see this in the
history archive.&nbsp; If this is undesirable, the command here should
read "<span class="QuotedKeywords">PRESS TO ALL BUT GO FAKE
BROADCAST</span>".]&nbsp; Then in the same (or a separate) message to
the adjudicator (since there can be more than one press message
per mail message) Italy could send the following:</p>
<div class="ExampleBox">
<p class="Example">PRESS TO R<br>
This is Austria, boy that Germany sure is obnoxious.&nbsp; Let's go
all out against him!<br>
<br>
-Ferdinand<br>
SIGNOFF</p>
</div>
<p class="Indent2">Russia would get the message with a header of
"Message to Russia in 'gamename':".&nbsp; Remember, we said this was a
Grey press game -- if the game was White press, Italy's name
would be in the header (which would kind of spoil the effect).&nbsp;
If it was White/Grey, Italy would have to throw in the "<span
class="QuotedKeywords">GREY</span>" keyword to get the effect,
but even then (or if the game was Grey/White) it wouldn't quite
be the same since if Germany really meant to be so obnoxious why
wouldn't he just send the messages out as white press?</p>
<p class="Indent1">Press to the Master only is always allowed, no
matter what the press settings are, so that requests for deadline
extensions, or any other message needing the Master's attention,
can be sent without having to resort to direct email outside of
the game. Likewise, a Master can always issue press commands, to
communicate with the players.</p>
<p class="Indent1">There are some commands that cause the Judge
to send messages to all the players (<i>e.g.</i>, changing your
return address in a non-gunboat game). If one of these commands
has been processed and a partial, faked partial or grey press
message is attempted, the Judge will send out the notice(s) as
separate messages, to all players, and the partial, faked, or
grey press will be sent as designated.</p>

<h1>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="creatingandmastering">Creating and Mastering
Standard Games</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The commands in this section are used to
"moderate" games; that is, control various game settings
affecting deadlines, press, etc. Usually, these commands are
issued by a Master, who is a non-participant in the game.
However, the Judge also is configured to run "unmoderated" games,
in which any of the players can change some of the game settings.
Many Judges do not allow unmoderated games, so check with the
Judgekeeper before attempting to start this type of game. The
term "moderator" means either a Master in a moderated game, or
any player in an unmoderated game.</p>
<h2><a name="changingmoderationstatus">8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing
Moderation Status</a></h2>
<p class="CommandTermLast"><a name="BECOMEMASTER">BECOME
MASTER</a></p>
<p class="Indent1">When a game is created, the user who created
it is (under the default settings) signed on as a player. To make
the game moderated and become a Master, the user should include
this command immediately after the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#CREATE">CREATE</a></span> command. The
Judgekeeper can modify the default settings so that the person
who creates a game automatically becomes a Master, in which case
this command is unnecessary; however, it does no harm to use it
anyway.</p>
<p class="CommandTermLast"><a name="SETMODERATE">SET

<h2><a name="masteronlycommands">8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Master-only

<p class="MsoBodyText">The commands in this section can only be
issued by a Master, and therefore cannot be used at all in
unmoderated games.</p>
<p class="CommandTermLast"><a name="BECOME">BECOME power</a></p>
<p class="Indent1">Allows the moderator for a game to assume the
identity of a particular power. The <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">power</span> specification may be spelled out or
abbreviated. Any commands following this will be interpreted as
if they had been submitted by the specified power; this allows a
Master, for example, to change a player's password or to submit
orders for a power. As a result, no Master-only commands
(including another <span class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span>)
can follow a <span class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span>
command.</p>
<p class="Indent1">The player for "power" will receive a message
from the Judge advising him that the Master used the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> command and confirming all
commands entered by the Master. <b>Warning</b>: this message will
include Master commands that preceded the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> command. Masters therefore should
not use any commands in the same message as a <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> that they wouldn't want the player
to see.</p>
<p class="Indent1">The <span class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span>
command is useful in a number of situations. One use is to submit
commands for a particular power if, for example, the player for
that power gets disconnected from the network and calls the
Master on the phone to give his orders.</p>
<p class="Indent1">(Note, however, that a Master can submit
orders for any unit in the game without using the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> command. Orders for multiple units
can be specified on the same line, separated by commas or
semicolons; but you shouldn't mix orders for units belonging to
multiple powers on the same line. This technique is used in some
variants to allow the Master to manipulate the players' orders in
some way before entering them into the Judge. In other
situations, the <span class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span>
command is preferred, because otherwise the true owner of the
power will not receive the confirmation reply from the Judge.
Also, the "orders have been received" flag will <i>not</i> be set
for a particular power if their orders were submitted by the
Master without the <span class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span>
command. It this case, it may be necessary to use the <span
class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#PROCESS">PROCESS</a></span>
command to get the phase processed.)</p>
<p class="Indent1">You can also use the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> command to <span class=
"QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a></span> for
a player, either because the player isn't clear on how to do it
themselves, or because their requested absence exceeds the
current <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href="#SETMAXABSENCE">MAX
ABSENCE</a></span> setting. The <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">MAX ABSENCE</span> setting does not apply to
absences entered by the Master using the <span class=
"QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> command. However, Masters should
avoid approving unusually long delays without the consent of the
players (anything over two weeks is generally considered
"unusually long," although this depends on the expectations of
players in a particular game).</p>
<p class="Indent1">The <span class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span>
command does not reveal the power's password to the Master
(except on some older versions of the Judge software). However,
the Master can use the <span class="QuotedKeywords"><a href=
"#SET%20PASSWORD">SET PASSWORD</a></span> command after <span
class="QuotedKeywords">BECOME</span> to set a new password for a
player who has lost or forgotten theirs. Example:</p>

to avoid potential disaster if the Judge processed the desired

expose orders that players had pending. A typical "<span class=

to roll the game back to the very start you could use "<span

Standard game to the state that existed after Spring 1901 Moves
but before Fall 1901 Moves.</p>
<p class="Indent1">History is kept for at least a month, but it
may not be possible to go back too far &ndash; this command is
intended to go back one phase for the case where one person's
orders get messed up and need to be resubmitted. Orders for
intermediate turns that were skipped over should remain intact,
but those previous orders may wind up being meaningless based on
changes in the results of the reprocessed turn. Any pending
orders that existed will also be reprocessed so if they were
revised by hand the first time the replayed phase was processed
the revisions may get lost.</p>
<p class="Indent1">Most Masters make it a policy never to
