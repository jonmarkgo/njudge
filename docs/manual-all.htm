Introduction</a></h1>
<h2><a id="aboutthejudge" name="aboutthejudge">1.1.    About the
Judge</a></h2>
<p>This is a guide to using the Diplomacy&trade; Adjudicator,
better known as the <strong>Judge</strong>, an automated program
for the on-line play of the strategy game Diplomacy&trade;,
published by Hasbro, and many of its variants.</p>
<p>This manual only covers Judges using the
"<strong>njudge</strong>" software, distributed from the Njudge
Project (see <a href="#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>). These are
not the only computer adjudicator programs in existence; you can
get information about others from the sources listed below. You
can also play Diplomacy on-line through human adjudicators, or by
postal mail, or even (believe it or not!) face-to-face.</p>
<p>Diplomacy played via e-mail has existed for almost as long as
e-mail has been available to the private consumer. There are
several groups, such as the AOL Diplomacy group, the
well-regarded CompuServe Diplomacy group, and the Cat23 group
that have organized to run games over the web not using the Judge
system. But it is the Judge system that defines a good portion of
the Internet hobby, and has probably influenced more of its
development than anything else. (There is also a system called
the "<strong>DPJudge</strong>", which has a WWW interface and
uses different software than the Ken Lowe judges, although it is
an outgrowth of the email Judge system. This manual does not
cover the DPJudge.)</p>
<p>The initial Judge code was written by Ken Lowe in the late
1980s as a project to test his understanding of the C programming
language. The code has since been and continues to be improved
upon by the hard work of several different programmers. Ken Lowe
also set up and acted as judgekeeper for the first Judge, USWA.
USWA carried the hobby for several years assisted by one or two
other Judges, until it folded, causing concern that the Judge
hobby would die with it. Fortunately, though, other hobbyists
came through and set up Judges. At this writing, there are over a
dozen public judges in operation world-wide, including several
for non-English-speaking players.</p>
<p>Each Judge is operated independently by a volunteer
administrator, known as the <strong>Judgekeeper</strong>, and is
identified by a four-letter code (such as "USWA" in the previous
paragraph). At the moment, each Judge is a completely autonomous
system. Users must register with each Judge separately, and
communicate with each Judge separately. In particular, different
Judges may be running different versions of the
<strong>njudge</strong> software, so commands that work on one
Judge will not necessarily work on all others. Where possible,
this manual will indicate the software version in which each
command was introduced.</p>
<p>Finally, using the Judge requires some knowledge of the rules
of Diplomacy. The Diplomacy rules themselves are copyrighted by
Hasbro, and are available (at this writing) at <a
href="http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF">http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF</a>.
However, this manual does not cover either the rules or the
strategy of Diplomacy.</p>
<h2><a id="aboutthismanual" name="aboutthismanual">1.2.    About
this Manual</a></h2>
<p>This document is called the User's Manual because it is
designed for users, not for system administrators. This manual is
intended as a useful reference for anyone who masters, plays in,
or observes games on a Judge. However, new users may find it
easier to start with the introductory Guide to the Judge,
available by sending the command "<span class="Keywords"><a
href="#GET">GET guide</a></span>" in a message to the Judge.</p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to list all the commands that
users may send to the Judge, provide examples of proper and
improper usage of the commands, and explain what kinds of errors
may occur and how to fix them. It is <em>not</em> a guide to how
to play the game of Diplomacy. <a href="#wheretofind">Section
1.3</a> lists many useful resources for players on strategy,
tactics, variants, and other game-related information.</p>
<h3><a id="howinformationis" name="howinformationis">1.2.1.</a>  
How Information Is Presented In This Manual</h3>
<p>The following chapters of this manual include examples of
commands to the Judge. To make the examples clearer, they will
always be displayed in a distinctive style. Commands to send to
the Judge will appear like this:</p>
<p class="plainindent1">GET filename</p>
<p>Words shown in <span class="Keywords">ALL CAPS</span>, like
"<span class="Keywords">GET</span>" in the example above, are
<strong>keywords</strong> that should be typed exactly as they
appear. Words shown in lower case, like "filename" in the
example, are placeholders that you replace with specific
information (in this example, the name of a file you want the
Judge to send you). The use of upper and lower case in these
examples is only for the purpose of distinguishing between
keywords and non-keywords; the actual commands can be typed in
either upper- or lower-case (with one exception; see <a
href="#thedeadlinesystem">section 5.1</a>).</p>
<p>Also, the Judge generally ignores spacing between keywords,
so, for instance, "<span class="Keywords">SET NOWAIT</span>"
works just as well as "<span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SETWAIT">SET NO WAIT</a></span>" or even "<span
class="Keywords">SETNOWAIT</span>". (But inserting spaces inside
a keyword, like "<span class="Keywords">SET NOW AIT</span>", will
cause an error!) This was not always true on versions before
1.4.0, so if a multi-word command that looks right, like "<span
class="Keywords"><a href="#IAMALSO">I AM ALSO</a></span>", causes
a mysterious error message, try the same command without spaces
(IAMALSO) and see if it works that way.</p>
<p>Items in square brackets are optional. Words separated by
vertical bars (|) indicate a choice of one of the words. Again,
these symbols are only shown to explain the proper syntax. Users
do not type in the square brackets or vertical bars!</p>
<p>Most command options are self-explanatory. "name" means the
name of a game, which must be no more than 8 alphanumeric
characters. "email" means a valid email address. "power" means
the name (not just the first letter) of one of the powers in the
game, which depends on the variant being played. The letter "p"
will be used where the initial of a power is required.</p>
<p><em>Caution</em>: whenever any setting is described in this
manual as the "default," that means only that it is set that way
in the software as provided from <a
href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a> &ndash;
however, any Judgekeeper can change the default for games created
on his system, and Masters can change those defaults for
individual games. When in doubt, check the game listing (see
<span class="Keywords"><a href="#LIST">LIST</a></span>, <a
href="#gameinformationcommands">section 3.4</a>) to see what
settings are actually in effect.</p>
<p>A number in braces {like this} in the right-hand margin after
the command definition indicates the first Judge version number
in which the command appeared. If this number is absent, then the
command is believed to be available in all currently used Judge
versions (although this has not been verified). [Note: some
commands marked as version {0.8.9} may actually have been
introduced in versions 0.8.8 or 0.8.7, but this makes no real
difference since no public Judge is running either of those two
versions at this time.] There are also a few Judges running
customized software not based on the <strong>njudge</strong>
code; these Judges are unlikely to accept the commands shown with
a version number in this Manual. To find which Judges are running
which versions of the software, see <a
href="http://gem.win.co.nz/judge/judgevers.html">http://gem.win.co.nz/judge/judgevers.html</a>.</p>
<p>Examples that illustrate an entire email communication with
the Judge will be shown as illustrated below, but will not follow
the upper- and lower-case convention discussed above:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">To: usxx@judgesite.com<br />
Subject: Help Me Please<br />
<br />
sign on rhappy password<br />
press to m<br />
Please help me! I don't know what I'm doing!<br />
endpress<br />
sign off</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, examples of responses from the Judge will be shown as
in the following illustration (most mail headers have been
omitted in the interest of clarity):</p>
<div class="judgeexample">
<p class="judgeexample">From: &lt;usxx@judgesite.com&gt;<br />
To: &lt;player@address.com&gt;<br />
Subject: USXX:happy - F1905M Deadline Adjustment to: Fri Feb 14
2003 23:30:00 -0500<br />
Date: Tuesday, February 11, 2003 3:11 PM<br />
<br />
All unmoderated games will be removed.<br />
Judge address is usxx@judgesite.com<br />
New Registrations will be reviewed for completeness and<br />
removed without notice if determined incomplete.<br />
<br />
master@domain.tld as Master set the deadline<br />
for game 'happy' to Fri Feb 14 2003 23:30:00 -0500.</p>

<h3><a id="terminology" name="terminology">1.2.2.</a>    
Terminology</h3>
<p>Here are a few commonly-used terms that you should be familiar
with:</p>

<dd>A human being, not necessarily the same person as the
Judgekeeper, who is in charge of a particular game being played
on the Judge.</dd>
<dt>Moderator</dt>
<dd>In a "moderated" game, this means the same thing as Master.
But, in an unmoderated game, any player can act as a Moderator
and do many (but not all) of the things a Master can do. See
sections 8.1 and 8.2 below.</dd>
<dt>Observer</dt>
<dd>A person who is not playing in a game, but who receives the
game reports and, in some cases, may be able to communicate with
the players through the Judge.</dd>
<dt>Player</dt>
<dd>A person who is participating in a game being run on the
Judge.</dd>
<dt>Power</dt>
<dd>One of the positions (7 in a standard game) played in a game
being run on the Judge. Please note that "power" identifies the
position being played, while "player" identifies the individual
playing that position.</dd>

<p>For Judge players, Alain T&eacute;sio's Diplomacy Tools at <a
href="http://www.floc.net/">http://www.floc.net/</a> are
indispensable. This site allows you to retrieve a map of the
current position of any game on any public Judge; game history
and list information; and stored maps of previous moves. You can
also set up a customized page that keeps track of all your games,
including deadlines (converted into your local time zone), maps,
results, and even a link to send mail to the Judge. Many tasks
can be performed more quickly and easily using these tools than
by using Judge commands!</p>

<h1><strong><a id="introductiontothe"
name="introductiontothe">2.</a>     Introduction to the
Judge</strong></h1>
<h2><a id="quickstartfor" name="quickstartfor">2.1.</a>   Quick
Start for New Users</h2>
<p>If you have never used the Judge before, don't worry &ndash;
you don't have to read this entire Manual before you start
playing. However, there are some basics you need to understand.
This Manual is designed more as a reference than as a tutorial;
you might find it easier to start with a page designed for new
players. Check the links at <a
href="http://devel.diplom.org/Online/judge.html">http://www.diplom.org/Online/judge.html</a>.
But, if you insist on reading ahead, here are the suggested key
sections:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListBullet">Read sections <a
href="#aboutthejudge">1.1</a>, <a
href="#communicatingwiththe">2.2</a>, <a href="#whatdoi">2.3</a>,
and <a href="#thesinglemost">3.1</a> so that you understand what
the Judge is, what it does, and what it doesn't do.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read <a href="#wheretofind">section
1.3</a> and take a look at the various resources listed there.
Especially, check out the Judge Openings List and the Game Queue
page, if you want to find a game that you can join quickly.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read about the <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#REGISTEREND">REGISTER</a></span> command in <a
href="#playerinformationand">section 3.3</a>. Then, when you are
ready to play, you can register on the Judge that is hosting your
game.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read about the <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> command in <a
href="#creatingobservingand">section 4</a>. You will need to use
this to join a game.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">If you are joining a new game, rather than
taking over a replacement position, then you will probably want
to use the <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETPREFERENCE">SET
PREFERENCE</a></span> command in <a
href="#generalcommands">section 7.1</a>.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Read <a href="#thedeadlinesystem">section
5.1</a> so that you understand how deadlines are set, and why it
is important to pay attention to them.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">If you have played Diplomacy face-to-face
or in other settings, you probably already know how to write your
orders, but you might want to review <a
href="#moveretreatand">section 6.1</a> to see what formats the
Judge will accept. You should definitely read <a
href="#convoyroutesmust">section 6.2</a>, too, because sooner or
later you are going to be involved in a convoy order.</li>
<li class="ListBullet">Finally, skim through <a
href="#otherplayercommands">section 7</a> to see other commands
that you might need to use during a game. The most important ones
to understand are <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET
WAIT</a></span>, <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETABSENCE">SET
ABSENCE</a></span>, and the <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#PRESS">PRESS</a></span> commands in <a
href="#presscommands">section 7.4</a>. Don't worry about "color
options" and "fake options" at this point; just read the basics
about how to send a press message to one or more other players,
including the "delivery options" section.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Judge itself provides a more extensive guide for new
users. Send an e-mail message to your favorite Judge (running
version 1.4.0 or higher) containing the line "<span
class="Keywords"><a href="#GET">GET</a> GUIDE</span>" in the
body.</p>
<h2><a id="communicatingwiththe"
name="communicatingwiththe">2.2.</a>   Communicating with the
Judge</h2>
<p>The Judge is an <strong>e-mail based</strong> system. All
communications to and from the Judge are sent by e-mail. There is
no direct WWW access to a Judge, although Judge information can
be retrieved and viewed through several WWW sites. In order to
use a Judge, therefore, you must have e-mail access and you must
obtain the e-mail address of a Judge (see <a
href="#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>).</p>
<p>It is <em>highly</em> <em>recommended</em> that you use a mail
program or system that allows you to send plain-text messages
(also known as ASCII or Unformatted Text in some software), as
the Judge cannot process any messages that contain HTML tags,
MIME encoding, or other non-text commands. However, most problems
with formatted mail can be avoided by religious use of the <span
class="Keywords"><a href="#SIGNOFF">SIGN OFF</a></span> command
(see <a href="#thesinglemost">section 3.1</a>).</p>
<p>If the Judge is functioning correctly, it should send a reply
to every e-mail message sent to it. The reply is ordinarily sent
to the address found in the <em>last</em> Reply-to: header
contained in the received mail message. Usually this will be the
same address that your message was sent from, but some users may
wish to receive the Judge replies at a different address. You may
be able to change your Reply-to address using your mail software;
alternatively, however, you can simply type a return address at
the beginning of your message, using the following format:</p>
<p class="plainindent1">REPLY-TO: username@domain.tld</p>
<p>If you are getting unwanted duplicate replies from the Judge,
see <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETADDRESS">SET
ADDRESS</a></span> in <a href="#generalcommands">section
7.1</a>.</p>
<p>Commands to the Judge are entered in the body of the mail
message. The Judge does not process the subject line, but does
echo it back in its reply so that you can easily tell which reply
corresponds to which outgoing message.</p>
<h2><a id="whatdoi" name="whatdoi">2.3.</a>   What Do I Do If the
Judge is Down?</h2>
<p>Yes, it does happen sometimes: you send a message to the
Judge, and no reply comes back; or, a deadline goes by but you
receive no results, no late notice, nothing at all. There can be
a couple of explanations for this.</p>
<p>It could mean (a) the Judge is down, in which case it will
usually process your message when it comes back up; (b) your mail
didn't reach the Judge in the first place, which could be due to
a problem with your ISP or some intermediate system in the
Internet mail relay system; or (c) the Judge did send you a
message but you didn't receive it for one of the reasons
suggested in (b). Some "anti-spam" programs have been known to
falsely identify particular Judges as spam senders and block mail
messages from them without warning. If this happens to you, you
can either complain to your ISP or find another ISP for sending
and receiving email.</p>
<p>A good way to check whether the problem is with your email or
with the Judge is to view the Judge Openings List (see <a
href="#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>), which will report the last
time each Judge's listing was updated. If your Judge's time is
not about the same as all the others', then there is something
wrong with the Judge. At this point, the Judgekeeper will already
have been sent an email from the Openings List alerting him to
the problem, so there is no need for you to contact him directly.
You may also wish to check the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup to
see if there is any announcement about the Judge's status.</p>
<p>If the Judge is down, <em>don't</em> continue to send mail to
it; wait until it responds to the messages you have already sent.
At best, sending repeated messages will flood your inbox with a
huge volume of replies when the Judge revives, and may delay
processing of games. At worst, you may end up having the wrong
commands recorded, because the Judge may not receive your
messages in the same order as you sent them. The best thing to do
is just wait until the Judge is restored, even though this can be
nerve-wracking for some people. You may be recorded as "late" if
a deadline expires during the time the Judge is down, but any
Master will surely forgive such an offense, and if it is an
isolated incident then the effect on your dedication ratings will
be minimal.</p>
<p>If you are a Master and the Judge goes down for an extended
period, it is usually best to wait until it is restored before
trying to "fix" any problems. If you send commands to change
deadlines, for example, the Judge may process the pending turn
before it gets to your <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SETDEADLINE">SET DEADLINE</a></span> command, so that you
could inadvertently change the deadline for the <em>next</em>
phase. One thing that you can do while the Judge is down,
however, is to send a <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SET_LIST">SET NO LIST</a></span> command if your game is
public. If the deadline and grace period should expire during the
outage, this will prevent the game from being listed publicly,
and prevent any of your players' positions from being taken over
by a replacement. Once the Judge is restored, you can then set an
appropriate new deadline.</p>
<h2><a id="dateformats" name="dateformats">2.4.</a>   Date
Formats</h2>
<p>Several Judge commands involve the use of dates. The Judge
accepts dates from users only in a few specific formats. If you
are using a Judge that has been modified to accept non-English
commands, you should check with the Judgekeeper to determine
whether the date strings have also been changed.</p>
<p>Dates may include one or more of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListBullet">A weekday, which must be one of these
three-letter abbreviations: 
<p class="optionterm">SUN | MON | TUE | WED | THU | FRI | SAT</p>
</li>
<li class="ListBullet">A month, which must be one of these
three-letter abbreviations: 
<p class="optionterm">JAN | FEB | MAR | APR | MAY | JUN | JUL |
AUG | SEP | OCT | NOV | DEC</p>
</li>
<li class="ListBullet">A day of the month (a number from 1 to 31,
inclusive), optionally followed by a comma;</li>
<li class="ListBullet">A four-digit year</li>
<li class="ListBullet">A numeric time using the 24-hour clock
format "hh:mm"</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, these elements may appear in any order. So, for
example, "Jun 15 23:30" and "23:30 15 Jun" are equivalent (and,
for that matter, "Jun 23:30 15" works too, even though this
syntax makes no sense to humans).</p>
<p>If the weekday is used, then the month and numeric day may not
be used. The weekday is converted into the next date (after the
current date) that falls on that day of the week. So, if today is
a Tuesday, "Tue" refers to the day one week from today.</p>
<p>If no year is specified, the current year is assumed
<em>unless</em> the month specified is earlier than the current
month and is no more than six months away; in that case, the
following year will be assumed. So, if it is currently December,
"10 Jan" is assumed to refer to the next year; but if it is
currently February, the same date will be assumed to refer to a
date in the past.</p>
<p>If a day number but no month is specified, the next date with
that day number will be used. If today is June 1, then "15"
without any month will be assumed to refer to June 15. If today
is June 20, however, the same command will refer to July 15.</p>
<p>If a month but no day is specified, the first day of the month
will be assumed, unless it is the current month, in which case
the current day will be assumed.</p>
<p>If no weekday, month, day, or year is specified, the current
day is assumed (except for the <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></span> command, see <a
href="#gameinformationcommands">section 3.4</a>).</p>
<p>If no time is specified, a default time will be assumed, which
depends on the specific command being executed.</p>
<p>All dates and times are based on the clock settings of the
computer system that the Judge is running on; usually, this is
the local time zone of the Judge system.</p>
<p>Dates are used in the commands: <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></span>, <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a></span>, <span
class="Keywords"><a href="#SETDEADLINE">SET DEADLINE</a></span>,

<h1><strong><a id="userregistrationand"
name="userregistrationand">3.</a>     User Registration and
Administrative Commands</strong></h1>
<p>Before you can join or observe a game on a Judge, you must be
a registered user of the Judge. There are a few commands,
however, that anyone can use even if they are not registered (one
of these, of course, is the command to register yourself).</p>
<h2><a id="thesinglemost" name="thesinglemost">3.1.</a>   The
Single Most Important Judge Command</h2>
<p>In this Manual, the last shall be first; thus, we begin with
the <em>last</em> command that should appear in every message you
send to a Judge:</p>
<table class="commandterm" summary="SIGNOFF command" border="0"
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="commandterm"><a id="SIGNOFF" name="SIGNOFF">SIGN
OFF</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="commandexplanation">Indicates the end of commands in a
message to the Judge. This prevents your signature file (or
taglines inserted by your e-mail provider) from being interpreted
as orders and/or being sent out as part of a press message. If
this command is not used, the Judge will attempt to parse all
characters in the mail message until the end of the file is
reached. This can result in your moves being rejected due to
errors, or worse: too many players to count have revealed their
passwords because they forgot to put <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#ENDPRESS">ENDPRESS</a></span> and <span
class="Keywords">SIGN OFF</span> after their press, and also
forgot to set their mail program to send <a
href="#communicatingwiththe">plain text</a> messages. Their mail
programs then attached a nicely formatted HTML copy of their
entire message, including the <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> command complete with password,
after the plain text version, which the Judge duly treated as
part of their press! You should develop a habit of including this
line at the end of <em>every</em> message you send to the
Judge.</p>

<p class="commandexplanation">Retrieve (by email) history
information for the specified game. The history information is
all the messages that an observer would have seen had he been
signed on for the time period. This includes turn results,
broadcast press, and informational notices (deadline adjustments,

find it easier to retrieve this information from Alain

<p class="commandexplanation">The command "<span

will retrieve all history for the period from one week ago (real
time) to the present, up to a maximum of 1000 lines. Other

covered and the length of the response, as follows:</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">(Syntax 1)</p>
<p class="optionterm">HISTORY name [FROM date] [TO date] [LINES
n]</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">This form retrieves the history
information for the specified game ("name") for the specified
time period (in real time rather than game time). For the valid
"date" formats, see <a href="#dateformats">section 2.4</a>. If
"<span class="Keywords">FROM date</span>" is omitted, the start
of the period is the current system time minus 7 days. If "<span
class="Keywords">TO date</span>" is omitted, the end of the
period is the current system time. If a date is specified but
does not include a time of day, the time period begins or ends at
midnight on the specified date.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">To get the earliest part of the
history (or the whole history), use a date that is known to be
earlier than the game start date. 1 Jan 1990 (or Jan 1, 1990) is
usually sufficient for this purpose.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The "lines" option can be used to
limit (or increase) the number of lines that will be returned by
the adjudicator. The default is 1000.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">Examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">history foo from Jan 1, 2003</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">This will return history of game
"foo" starting at midnight on Jan 1, 2003, up to the end of the

first.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">history foo from Jan 1, 1990 to Dec 31, 2002
23:59 lines 5000</p>

<p class="optionexplanation">This will <em>not</em> perform as
expected &ndash; if the start date is not specified, it defaults
to the current system time minus seven days. Since the end date
is before the start date, it will be ignored. Therefore, this

<h1><strong><a id="deadlinesanddedication"
name="deadlinesanddedication">5.</a>     Deadlines and Dedication
(or, Get Your Orders in on Time!)</strong></h1>
<h2><a id="thedeadlinesystem" name="thedeadlinesystem">5.1.</a>  
The Deadline System</h2>
<p>The Judge system administers deadlines for all games. House
rules normally require that you submit orders before the deadline
<em>whether you are finished with negotiations or not</em>! It is
considered unsportsmanlike, and possible grounds for expulsion,
to <em>deliberately</em> submit orders late for any reason, or to
continue negotiating past the deadline (unless your orders are
already submitted). On the other hand, illnesses, email
interruptions, and other unintended reasons for missing deadlines
do occur, and so the Judge system provides a grace period for
these events. If you miss both the deadline and the grace period,
your position may become abandoned and taken over by another
player.</p>
<p>Deadlines are always determined by the Judge's "local" time,
which is simply whatever time the system clock says on the
computer that is running the Judge software. The deadline notices
included in Judge messages will specify the "local" time zone, in
hours before or after GMT. For example:</p>
<div class="judgeexample">
<p class="judgeexample">The next phase of 'fubar' will be
Adjustments for Winter of 1908.<br />
The deadline for orders will be Mon Nov 17 2003 23:31:03
-0600.</p>
</div>
<p>This particular Judge's local time zone, as indicated by the
"-0600", is six hours earlier than GMT (<em>i.e.</em>, U.S.
Central Standard Time). If you don't want to mess around with
converting this to your own local time zone, do what the author
does &ndash; go to <a
href="http://www.floc.net/observer.py?page=login_screen">http://www.floc.net/observer.py?page=login_screen</a>
and create your own customized page, which will list the
deadlines for all your games in your local time zone (after you
set up your page and tell it which time zone to use).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, orders will be processed on the
following schedule. These default settings may be changed by the
Judgekeeper, and may be further changed for individual games by a
Master, or by any player in an unmoderated game, so be sure to
check your own game's listing.</p>
<pre>
Move    clock 1410 min 12.00 next  71.00 grace 167.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
Retreat clock   -1 min  0.00 next  23.00 grace  71.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
Adjust  clock   -1 min  0.00 next  23.00 grace  71.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
</pre>
<p>Each value goes with the keyword <em>before</em> it, not
after. (So the first line means "clock 1410"; "min 12.00"; etc.
&ndash; <em>not</em> "clock 1410 min" or "12.00 next".) The
meanings of the various settings are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt class="indent1">clock</dt>
<dd class="indent1">If non-negative, indicates the minutes past
midnight to which the new deadline will be set. 1410 is eleven
thirty pm. If negative, this parameter is ignored, and the new
deadline is set at exactly "next" hours after the time the
previous phase was processed.</dd>
<dt class="indent1">min</dt>
<dd class="indent1">Indicates the minimum number of hours that
can elapse between the previous phase and the new phase. Thus, in
the above example, there will be at least 12 hours after a build
or retreat phase before the movement orders will be processed.
This parameter has no real use other than to prevent a runaway
situation if all of the powers in a game were to go CD.</dd>
<dt class="indent1">next</dt>
<dd class="indent1">Indicates the number of hours after the
previous phase is processed that the new deadline will be set.
This may be increased to fit into the values of the 'clock'
and/or 'days' parameters. In the default case, movement orders
are three days after the previous phase. However, because of the
"clock" setting, the deadline will be advanced to 11:30 p.m. on
the third day; and, because of the "days" setting, if the third
day falls on a weekend it will slide to Monday. (<em>Note</em>:
the "next" interval is specified as 71 hours, rather than 72,
because of the interaction between "next" and "clock". The Judge
does not process seasons instantaneously. If the Spring 1901
phase is processed, for example, at 11:35 pm Monday, then a "next
72.0" setting would require the next deadline to be at 11:35 pm
Thursday; but, since "clock" requires that the deadline be
exactly at 11:30 pm, this would push the deadline forward to
Friday.)</dd>
<dd class="indent1">In any event, the next deadline should never
be earlier than the deadline from the most recently processed
phase (thus, for example, if the moderator manually extends the
current deadline for two weeks to allow for a player absence, but
then the turn is processed because the absent player was nice
enough to submit orders before he left, the next deadline will
still be approximately two weeks away). The only exception to
this is if the moderator manually resets the deadline to an
earlier time.</dd>
<dt class="indent1">grace</dt>
<dd class="indent1">Indicates the number of hours the adjudicator
will wait after the deadline expires if not everyone has gotten
their orders in yet. In the default case, a grace period of one
week after the initial deadline is allowed. When the deadline
comes up, a reminder message will be sent to everyone who hasn't
gotten their orders in and a notice will be sent to the other
players and observers in the game indicating who is late. Another
reminder will be sent to the late parties, and a notice to all
other participants, every day.</dd>
<dd class="indent1">If the game is set "NoNMR" (the default), the
Judge will wait for orders until the end of the grace period.
Then, a notice will be sent to all players and observers in that
game indicating that the late power has been abandoned. Abandoned
powers may be taken over by anyone not already playing a power in
the game merely by signing on with any password. No orders will
be processed until the late power returns or is taken over.</dd>
<dd class="indent1">If the game is uses the NMR setting, the
power will be deemed abandoned if orders have not been received
by 24 hours <em>before</em> the end of the grace period. If you
are running an NMR game, therefore, your grace periods must be at
least 24 hours and normally should be at least 48. At the end of
the grace period, if complete orders still have not been
received, either from the original player or a replacement, the
power will be declared in "Civil Disorder" and the phase will be
processed with incomplete orders. On subsequent phases powers
marked CD will not be considered when deciding whether the
deadline should slide. When a valid <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a></span> is received, the CD and/or
abandoned status will be cleared.</dd>
<dd class="indent1">As with the deadline, the program should
never set a grace period that is earlier than the grace period
from the last processed season, although a moderator can change
this manually.</dd>
<dt class="indent1">delay</dt>
<dd class="indent1">Indicates the number of hours after the last
required orders have been received before the orders will be
processed. The default is 0.5 hours, so that if all powers get
their orders in before the deadline, the orders will be processed
thirty minutes later. This gives people a little time to change
their mind after orders are submitted.</dd>
<dt class="indent1">days</dt>
<dd class="indent1">Specifies which days of the week are valid
for the setting of the initial deadline. An uppercase letter
indicates that that day of the week is okay. If the letter is
lowercase, then the deadline is delayed until after noon. A dash
indicates that the deadline cannot fall on that day of the week.
Unless the "StrictGrace" flag has been set, the grace period also
will be extended to a day that is valid for the initial deadline.
<em>Warning</em>: this parameter is an exception to the general
rule that adjudicator commands are not case-sensitive!</dd>
</dl>
<p>These parameters can be changed by a moderator using the <span
class="Keywords">SET</span> command. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">SET MOVES NEXT 48.0 DELAY 1.0<br />
SET BUILDS DELAY 1.0</p>
</div>
<p>These commands will (a) set the default move deadline to (at
least) 48 hours after the previous phase was processed, and (b)
require a one-hour delay after the last player submits (timely)
move and build orders before the turn can be processed. These
commands will not change the deadlines for the currently pending
phase. See <a href="#deadlinerelatedsettings">section
8.6</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, a moderator can use the following commands to
override the standard deadline settings for the current phase
only: <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETDEADLINE">SET
DEADLINE</a></span>; <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SETGRACE">SET GRACE</a></span>; <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SETSTART">SET START</a></span>. See <a
href="#deadlinerelatedsettings">section 8.6</a>.</p>
<p>Orders can be sent in any time before the deadline. If
multiple movement orders are received for the same unit, the most
recent one received will override the earlier one. Attempting to
build or remove too many units during the adjustment phase will
cause the earliest received build/remove requests to be ignored.
Thus you can send in preliminary movement or adjustment orders
immediately and then send in revised orders after you change your
mind from diplomatic talks. Beware, though, that if everyone gets
their orders in before the deadline, the orders may be processed
before you have a chance to get your revised orders in.</p>
<p>If you include a <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET
WAIT</a></span> command with your orders, you can avoid having
your orders processed before the deadline. When you've decided
that your orders are final, you can send in a message with a
<span class="Keywords">SET NO WAIT</span> command to allow the
orders to be processed as soon as the delay period expires and
everyone else has their orders in. Remember that <span
class="Keywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a></span> is
cleared when the orders are processed, so you have to explicitly
set it again (if you want it) for each phase.</p>
<p>If the reply mail to any order indicates that there was an
error or you have a unit that you did not supply an order for or
you didn't explicitly specify all your builds, remove or
retreats, the flag indicating that your orders have been received
will not be set. All builds must be specified or explicitly <span
class="Keywords">WAIVE</span>'d before the adjudicator will
consider your build orders complete, unless it is impossible to
build all units (<em>e.g.</em>, five supply centers taken in a
single year or no vacant home centers). An error free set of
orders will be required to set the "has submitted orders" status.
If no error free orders have been received by the time the grace
period expires in an "NMR" game, the partial orders will be
processed and the CD status will be set for your power. See the
discussion on grace periods above for more info on what happens
when you miss a deadline and taking over abandoned powers.</p>
<h2><a id="dedicationsystems" name="dedicationsystems">5.2.</a>  
Dedication Systems</h2>
<p>"Dedication" refers to a player's history of submitting moves
on time and playing each position out to the bitter end. Doing
this is <em>good</em>; sending orders late and abandoning your
position when the game is going against you are <em>bad</em>.
Playing Diplomacy is a group effort and can take quite a while to
complete (as you know if you've played face-to-face); nobody
wants to play with someone who just disappears in the middle of
the game.</p>
<p>The Judge tracks player dedication in three ways. System (1)
tracks all games ever played on the Judge (unless the Judgekeeper
has reset the data files). Systems (2) and (3), which are newer,
only track turns played since they were installed on the Judge
(which varies by Judge, but was no earlier than 2002).</p>
<p class="hangingindent">(1) The original dedication system,
which has some flaws but is being maintained for continuity, is
based on a point system. The default values, which like all Judge
defaults can be changed by a particular Judgekeeper, are as
follows:</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">+3 points for getting your orders in
on time.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">-1 point for each "deadline missed"
reminder the judge sends you.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">-50 points for becoming
abandoned.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">-100 points for missing the grace
period and going CD.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">There is no penalty for resigning
before a deadline, if you submit complete orders <em>before</em>
you resign. However, you will continue to receive the -1 point
penalty every day that your power remains abandoned after the
deadline. If your power goes CD after you've resigned without
anyone else taking the power over, you will receive the CD
penalty as well (this is to discourage you from resigning when
you're down to a few units which could be used to affect the
final outcome of the game, but you've just lost interest).</p>
<p class="hangingindent">(2) The "ontime ratio" system. In this
system players are rated based on what percentage of their total
turns they have submitted on time. We use the following
formula:</p>
<pre>
                     Turns Submitted Ontime
      Rating  =  -----------------------------
                        Total turns due
</pre>
<p class="commandexplanation">Therefore each player has a rating
between 0.0 and 1.0, with higher rankings being better than lower
ones.</p>
<p class="hangingindent">(3) The "CD ratio" system, which
compares the number of times a player has gone into Civil
Disorder (<em>i.e.</em>, failed to submit complete orders by the
end of the grace period, regardless of whether the game was NMR
or not), to the number of games he has started. We use the
following formula:</p>
<pre>
                             Times in Civil Disorder
      Rating =  ----------------------------------------------------
                   Games started + abandoned positions taken over
</pre>
<p class="commandexplanation">Again ratings range from 0.0 to
1.0, but in this case lower ratings (fewer missed grace periods)
are preferable. (Actually, a player who is really sloppy about
deadlines could theoretically achieve a ratio above 1.0, but we
won't dwell on such an unhappy possibility.)</p>
<p>GMs or others creating games can restrict who is eligible to
sign on to the game based on dedication ratings, using the
commands <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETDEDICATION">SET

name="enteringorders">6.</a>     Entering Orders</strong></h1>
<h2><a id="moveretreatand" name="moveretreatand">6.1.</a>   Move,
Retreat, and Adjustment Orders for the Current Phase</h2>
<p>Following a <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SIGNON">SIGN
ON</a></span> command, a player may submit orders for his power
for the current phase simply by typing those orders in the body
of the mail message. Multiple orders can be entered on one line
by separating them with commas or semicolons.</p>
<p>Most orders can be written the same way they are customarily
written in face-to-face games, using the abbreviations shown in
the Diplomacy rulebook.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation"><em>Warning</em>: the syntax for
convoys is different than in the standard Diplomacy rules. See <a
href="#convoyroutesmust">section 6.2</a>.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation"><em>Warning</em>: if you want to
support a fleet moving to a bi-coastal province, you
<em>must</em> specify the coast to which the fleet is moving. If
you omit the coast in a support <em>or</em> move order for a
fleet that can move to either coast of a province, the Judge will
arbitrarily add a coast to the order (namely, the first one on
its list). This may lead to unintended results!</p>
<p>Also, unlike standard Diplomacy, the Judge does not require or
permit you to specify the power that owns a unit you are
supporting or convoying. (So you would just write "A Ven S A Tri"
rather than "A Ven S Austrian A Tri".) And, again unlike standard
Diplomacy, the Judge will not accept orders that are impossible
or badly-written (like A Par-Mun, or F Nth S
Philadelphia-Boston), or for units that you don't actually
control. Instead, erroneous orders will raise the "error flag,"
and orders will not be processed until the errors are
corrected.</p>
<p>If you have submitted any orders for the current phase, the
Judge will list these orders in its reply to every message you
send to it, until the phase is processed. It is <em>highly</em>
recommended that players check the orders in the Judge reply to
make sure their orders have been parsed as they intended, and to
make sure that all units have been ordered!</p>
<p>The following is an exhaustive list of the order syntax
recognized by the Judge. Some of these order formats may only be
used in variant games. Items in [square brackets] are
optional.</p>

<p>Province names can be abbreviated or can be spelled out. Valid
abbreviations can be found in the 'map' file for the variant you

&lt;coast&gt;, you can of course replace "north" or "n" with
another direction as appropriate.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of valid orders (assuming that the
player actually controls the units given in the orders):</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Movement phase orders:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">A Ber -&gt; Kie<br />
A Ser m Rum<br />
Lon-Nth<br />
F Kiel moves to Berlin<br />
Par H<br />
F Rome Stands<br />
A MUN S F KIE-BER<br />
A Brest supports Paris<br />
F Sev S A Ser M Rum</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">Note that, as in the example
"Lon-Nth", it is not necessary to specify the unit type, but
since Nth is a sea space the order will be rejected if the unit
in Lon is not actually a fleet.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Retreat phase orders:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">F Kiel m Den<br />
A Rum-Bul<br />
Par -&gt; Pic<br />
Mun disbands</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">As these examples show, retreats are
written exactly like movement orders, except when you are
disbanding a unit.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Adjustment phase orders:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">build A Lon<br />
F StP/sc<br />
remove A Tun</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">The order for "F StP/sc" will be
interpreted as either a build or a removal, depending on whether
the power has more supply centers than units, or vice versa.
<em>But</em> see <a href="#submittingordersfor">section 6.3</a>
regarding phased build/removal orders. In the case of a removal,
the unit type is also optional, so "Tun" would be a valid removal
order, too.</p>
<p>Note the difference between disband orders in a retreat phase,
and removal orders in an adjustment phase. In a retreat phase,
the word "disband" is required and comes <em>after</em> the unit
type and location; in an adjustment phase, the word "disband" or
"remove" is optional and, if used, comes <em>before</em> the unit
type and location.</p>
<p>Similarly, the syntax for transform orders (<em>which are used
only in variant games</em>) depends on whether it is a movement
or an adjustment phase. In a move phase, the unit location comes
first, followed by the transform command, then the new unit type.
In an adjustment phase, however, the transform command comes
first, followed by the <em>new</em> unit type, then the location.
Examples (assuming, in each case, that the player currently has a
fleet in Brest and an army in Spain, and that the current game
settings permit the desired transformations):</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Movement phase:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">F Brest transforms to Army<br />
Spain trafo F (sc)</p>
</div>
<p class="commandexplanation">Adjustment phase:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">Transform A Brest<br />
trafo f spa/sc</p>
</div>
<p>In both cases, the order will fail if the player does not
specify the <em>new</em> unit type (because this command is
supported in variants that recognize other unit types besides
armies and fleets); however, specifying the <em>old</em> unit
type is never required, and is not permitted in the adjustment
phase. The transformation of the army in Spain to a fleet will
also fail unless the player specifies which coast the fleet is to
be placed on. Finally, please note that while transform orders
can be abbreviated as "trafo", they cannot be abbreviated as "t"
because that abbreviation is reserved for convoy orders.</p>
<p>Revisions to orders can be sent in any time before the phase
is processed. Orders may be processed before the deadline unless
the <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a></span>
command has been used (see <a
href="#deadlinerelatedcommands">section 7.2</a>). The last valid
order for a particular unit will be honored. For Adjustment
phases, if you submit more build orders than you can use, the
last one(s) received will be honored. If no valid order is
received for a particular unit in an NMR game, it will be listed
in the reports as "No order processed".</p>
<h2><a id="convoyroutesmust" name="convoyroutesmust">6.2.</a>  
Convoy Routes Must Be Specified</h2>
<p>Unlike human adjudicators, the Judge requires that convoy
routes be specified. (Get file 'rules' for complete details on
differences between the Judge and the standard rules.) To do a
convoy, you must order each participating fleet to convoy the
army, and also must order the army to follow a specific convoy
route. For example:</p>
<div align="center">
<table summary="Convoy examples" valign="top" border="0"
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td class="tablelabels">RIGHT</td>
<td class="tablelabels">WRONG</td>

</table>
</div>
<p>The "wrong" column is correct according to the standard rules
of Diplomacy and the usual practice in human-adjudicated games,
but on the Judge it will raise the error flag!</p>
<p>The convoying fleets do not have to belong to the same power
as the army, or as each other; but if the route specified for the
army does not match up exactly with the fleet orders, the convoy
will fail. As shown above, only the army has to specify the
entire route; the fleets only need to give the origin and
destination.</p>
<p>The Judge generally does not check the "reasonableness" of a
convoy order, because of the complexity of checking all possible
units along all possible convoy paths. Convoy orders will be
accepted as long as the convoying fleet and the convoyed army
actually exist, and the destination is a (land) province defined
in the map file, unless the optional StrictConvoy flag is set
(see <a href="#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a>).</p>

If end_date is before start_date, the command will be ignored. If

<p class="commandexplanation">Setting an absence never extends
the <em>current</em> deadline; it only takes effect when a turn
is processed, if the <em>next</em> deadline using the normal
settings would fall after start_date. A player who is going away
needs to either submit their orders for the phase that is pending
at start_date before they leave, pick a start_date that is early
enough so that this won't be a problem, or ask the Master to
extend the current deadline. (Understandably, Masters may be
unhappy if you choose the last option.) It is also recommended
(though not required) that start_date and end_date be days on
which deadlines normally fall; for example, in a weekdays-only
game, setting an absence to start or end on a Saturday or Sunday
may yield undesired results.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Start_date and end_date may use any

<p class="example">Set Absence Jan 1 to Jan 15<br />
Set Absence 24 Jun to 3 Jul<br />
Set Absence Sat to Tue</p>
</div>
<p class="commandexplanation">Note that the last example will not
work if it is sent on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, as the Judge
will interpret "Sat" as the following Saturday, and "Tue" as
meaning 'this coming Tuesday', not 'Tuesday next week' as the
player seems to intend; the Judge will reject the absence because
it appears to end before it begins. It is therefore better in
most cases to specify the dates.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Only a maximum of three (3)
absences can be pending at any given time for a single player.
Once an absence expires, however, it is removed from memory and
its "slot" becomes available for another request. If you need to
change a previously-set absence, first use <span
class="Keywords">SET NO ABSENCE</span> to remove the old one,
then use <span class="Keywords">SET ABSENCE</span> to set the
correct dates. Otherwise, you will use up two of your slots.</p>

an informative message to the Master, and he will also see the

it to take effect. Generally, the Master should do this by using
the <span class="Keywords"><a href="#BECOME">BECOME
power</a></span> command (see <a
href="#masteronlycommands">section 8.2</a>) and setting the
absence for the player, as this allows the player to cancel or
change the absence later if desired. (Also, the Master, like each
player, has only three absence "slots," and might use them all up
setting absences for other players.) The <span

<p class="commandexplanation">Cast a vote in an automated draw.
The powerlist option is only valid if the game is set NoDIAS. Any
draw vote, DIAS or NoDIAS, is good for one phase only. All draw
votes are cleared at the end of a phase, so you need to cast your
vote again every phase (if you still want to agree to a draw). It
is normally not necessary to use <span class="Keywords">SET NO
DRAW</span> unless you change your mind in the middle of a phase,
since no draw can be passed without consent of all active
players.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The term "DIAS" means "Draws
Include All Survivors". By default, all games are DIAS. The
moderator can change this with the <span class="Keywords">SET NO
DIAS</span> or <span class="Keywords">SET DIAS</span> commands.
See <a href="#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a>. In a DIAS
game, a surviving player cannot be excluded from a draw. In a
NoDIAS game, a surviving player may give up his right to be
included in a draw. In either case, unanimous approval of
surviving players is required for a draw to be passed.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">In a DIAS game, a player may cast
his vote for a draw by issuing the command <span
class="Keywords">SET DRAW</span>. He may withdraw earlier
approval by issuing the command <span class="Keywords">SET NO
DRAW</span>. If at any time all surviving players agree to a DIAS
draw, the game will be immediately terminated (without waiting
for the next deadline), and all participants in the game will be
informed of the result.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The situation for NoDIAS games is a
bit more complex. To vote for a NoDIAS draw, a player issues the
command "<span class="Keywords">SET DRAW powerlist</span>", where
<span class="Keywords">powerlist</span> is a list of the
identifiers for the powers he wishes included in the draw. When a
player gives approval to <span class="Keywords">powerlist</span>
and <span class="Keywords">powerlist</span> includes his own
power, he is also implicitly approving any subset of <span
class="Keywords">powerlist</span> that also includes his power.
On the other hand, when a player gives approval to <span
class="Keywords">powerlist</span> and <span
class="Keywords">powerlist</span> does <em>not</em> include his
own power, he is implicitly approving any subset of <span
class="Keywords">powerlist</span>, <em>and</em> any subset of
<span class="Keywords">powerlist</span> plus his own power.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">For example, if Austria issued the
command <span class="Keywords">SET DRAW AEG</span>, he is
approving the draws AEG, AG, AE, or A. Note that by including
himself in his draw list, he is assuring that he cannot be
excluded from a draw. If Austria issues <span
class="Keywords">SET DRAW A</span>, he is accepting <em>any</em>
draw as long as it includes him. If Austria issues <span
class="Keywords">SET DRAW FT</span>, he is approving FT, F, T,
AFT, AF, AT, or A.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">If, under these rules, more than
one draw is approved by all players, the draw including the most
players passes.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">In a NoDIAS game, <span
class="Keywords">SET NO DRAW</span> is equivalent to the command
<span class="Keywords">SET DRAW x</span>, where x is the power
issuing the command. This means that the player will only accept
a concession to himself.</p>

Judge will not verify the source of the message. <strong>Fake
press</strong> (which may be white or gray) is a message sent to
one or more players that is made by the Judge to appear as a
broadcast message to all people or to an alternate set of people.
Finally, <strong>Postal Press</strong> is delayed until after the
results of the current phase have been processed (while all other
press is sent immediately).</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The results of the <span
class="Keywords"><a href="#LIST">LIST</a></span> command will
indicate, among other things, the types of press allowed in a
particular game. Possible settings are:</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">None:</p>

<p class="commandexplanation">White:</p>

show up on list output.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Observer white:</p>

<p class="commandexplanation">No Partial:</p>
<p class="indent2">Only broadcast messages to all players can be

the Master only. This option is only useful in Gunboat variants
where the identities of the other players are unknown.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">-------</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">No Fake:</p>
<p class="indent2">Messages sent to individuals cannot appear as

<p class="indent2">Players may send delayed (broadcast-only)
messages that will not be distributed until after the current

lieu of, other forms of press.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The press setting values listed
above can also be used by a moderator as command keywords, after
the <span class="Keywords">SET</span> command, to change the
types of allowable press. See <a
href="#gameaccesssettings">section 8.4</a>. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">SET GREY, PARTIAL FAKES BROADCAST</p>
</div>
<p class="commandexplanation">would mean that all press (except
to or from the Master) would appear to be a grey broadcast
message, even if it is actually sent to only one player. The
commas are optional. (The press settings that appear in the <span
class="Keywords"><a href="#LIST">LIST</a></span> results will not
be in exactly the same format as shown above; for example, the
"Observers None" setting would appear as "No Observers".)</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Note: If fake press is allowed in a
game, press to the Master will <em>not</em> be faked, and you
will get scolded if you try.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">By default, games are "White,
Partial Allowed, No Fake, No PostalPress".</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Options:</p>
<p class="indent2"><em>Note</em>: The <span
class="Keywords">BROADCAST</span> command without options is
equivalent to "<span class="Keywords">PRESS TO ALL</span>"; that
is, the message will be sent to all players. However, using the
PRESS command without any options will result in no message being
sent. This is to prevent accidental broadcasts, which can result
in your secret attack plans being sent to the entire game.
Finally, if <span class="Keywords">BROADCAST</span> <em>is</em>
followed by options, it is treated exactly the same as a <span
class="Keywords">PRESS</span> command (so if, for some odd
reason, you wrote "<span class="Keywords">BROADCAST TO G</span>",
the message would go only to Germany and not to the entire
game).</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">(1) color-options</p>
<p class="optionterm">WHITE | UNANONYMOUS | UNANONYMOUSLY</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The message is sent out with your
power and return address specified. This is only necessary if
white and grey press are both allowed and grey is the default.
This is the most common use of press, and results in a message
that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="judgeexample">
<p class="judgeexample">Message from bismarck@berlin.net as
Germany to France in 'gamename':<br />
<br />
Greetings, neighbor. I do hope we will have peace between our
great countries, and that you will recognize the historic ties
between Alsace-Lorraine and the rest of Germany.<br />
<br />
Bismarck</p>
</div>
<p class="optionterm">GREY | ANONYMOUS | ANONYMOUSLY</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The message is sent out with no
indication as to the originator. This is only necessary if white
and grey press are both allowed and white is the default. Suppose
France sends the command "<span class="Keywords">PRESS GREY TO
G</span>": then Germany will receive a message like the
following, with no indication that it came from France:</p>
<div class="judgeexample">
<p class="judgeexample">Message to Germany in 'gamename':<br />
<br />
My agents report that Russia is moving to Silesia. Be wary!<br />
<br />
Mata Hari</p>
</div>
<p class="commandexplanation">(2) delivery-options</p>
<p class="optionterm">TO list</p>
<p class="optionterm">+list</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The message will be sent only to the
list of powers specified. The list consists of the single
character identifier for the powers combined as a single word.
Thus "<span class="Keywords">PRESS TO FRG</span>" would send the
message to France, Russia and Germany in a Standard game. In most
variants the first letter of the power is usually the character
(but not always; for instance, India in the Youngstown variant is
'N' because 'I' is used to represent Italy). The special
characters 'O' and 'M' are interpreted Observer and Master
respectively in all variants.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation"><em>Warning</em>: only use initials
in the list; you may be dismayed if you type "<span
class="Keywords">PRESS TO Turkey</span>", because the Judge will
try to interpret "Turkey" as a list of initials. In a Standard
game, this will result in an error message, because U, K, and Y
are not valid power initials; in some variants, however, you
might end up sending a message to six players!</p>
<p class="optionterm">TO ALL BUT list</p>
<p class="optionterm">-list</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The message is sent to all powers
<em>except</em> those specified in the list. Note that since all
press that can be read by Observers is archived in the game's
history file, a message sent "<span class="Keywords">PRESS TO ALL
BUT R</span>" (for example) will be available to Russia by means
of the History command. Use "<span class="Keywords">PRESS TO ALL
BUT RO</span>" to be sure that the message isn't archived. Also,
remember that a Master is able (if he wants) to read all press
regardless of how it is addressed.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">(3) Fake options</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The Judge's "fake press" options are
not often used, and as a result are not widely understood. "Fake"
press is press with a forged "To" line; you cannot use these
options to make it look like press came <em>from</em> someone
else. To hide the origin of press, you have to use the "<span
class="Keywords">GREY</span>" color-option.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The main use of "fake" press is to
try to fool certain players into thinking that other players did
or did not see your message when that is not the case. For
example, you could send a partial press only to one player but
make it look like a broadcast; or you could send a partial press
to France and Germany addressed only to France (so that France
doesn't know Germany also saw it). Some combinations of these
options will work but not make much sense; for instance, if you
send a message to Italy and it says "Press to Turkey" at the top,
he will obviously know it is faked.</p>
<p class="optionterm">[NO] FAKE [BROADCAST]</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The message is faked (or not) as a
broadcast message to all players. The "<span class="Keywords">NO
FAKE</span>" option is needed only in a game that has the
"Partial Fake Broadcast by Default" setting.</p>
<p class="optionterm">FAKE [PARTIAL] delivery-option</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">The message is faked as going to the
set of people specified even though it may be a broadcast message
or be a message sent to an alternate set of people. The
delivery-option may be any of the forms listed in the previous
section.</p>
<p class="optionexplanation">For fake press, you must first
specify the real recipients of the press (if not specified, a
broadcast is assumed), then put the word "<span
class="Keywords">FAKE</span>" followed by the addressees to be
named in the message header (again, if not specified, it is
assumed that a fake broadcast is intended). For example, "<span
class="Keywords">PRESS FAKE TO FRG</span>" will be interpreted as
a broadcast message to everyone that is faked as going to France,
Russia and Germany rather than a message going to France, Russia
and Germany that is faked as a broadcast. If the latter was
intended, the keyword "<span class="Keywords">FAKE</span>" can be
placed at the end as in "<span class="Keywords">PRESS TO FRG
FAKE</span>" or the keyword "<span
class="Keywords">BROADCAST</span>" must be specified as in "<span
class="Keywords">PRESS FAKE BROADCAST TO FRG</span>". As an
example in a Grey press game allowing fake broadcasts, Italy
might start off the game by posting the following press
message:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">SIGNON Ggamename password</p>
<p class="example">PRESS TO ALL BUT G FAKE BROADCAST<br />
This is Germany and I think you all are wimps. I bet I can win
even if you all gang up against me.<br />
<br />
-Kaiser Bill<br />
ENDPRESS</p>
<p class="example">SIGNOFF</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">Everyone but Germany would get a
press message that looks like this:</p>
<div class="judgeexample">
<p class="judgeexample">Broadcast message in 'gamename':<br />
<br />
This is Germany and I think you all are wimps. I bet I can win
even if you all gang up against me.<br />
<br />
-Kaiser Bill</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">[Remember, however, that if Germany
thinks to issue a <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></span> command, he can see this in
the history archive. If this is undesirable, the command here
should read "<span class="Keywords">PRESS TO ALL BUT GO FAKE
BROADCAST</span>".] Then in the same (or a separate) message to
the adjudicator (since there can be more than one press message
per mail message) Italy could send the following:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="example">PRESS TO R<br />
This is Austria, boy that Germany sure is obnoxious. Let's go all
out against him!<br />
<br />
-Ferdinand<br />
SIGNOFF</p>
</div>
<p class="optionexplanation">Russia would get the message with a
header of "Message to Russia in 'gamename':". Remember, we said
this was a Grey press game -- if the game was White press,
Italy's name would be in the header (which would kind of spoil
the effect). If it was White/Grey, Italy would have to throw in
the "<span class="Keywords">GREY</span>" keyword to get the
effect, but even then (or if the game was Grey/White) it wouldn't
quite be the same since if Germany really meant to be so
obnoxious why wouldn't he just send the messages out as white
press?</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Press to the Master only is always
allowed, no matter what the press settings are, so that requests
for deadline extensions, or any other message needing the
Master's attention, can be sent without having to resort to
direct email outside of the game. Likewise, a Master can always
issue press commands, to communicate with the players.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">There are some commands that cause
the Judge to send messages to all the players (<em>e.g.</em>,
changing your return address in a non-gunboat game). If one of
these commands has been processed and a partial, faked partial or
grey press message is attempted, the Judge will send out the
notice(s) as separate messages, to all players, and the partial,
faked, or grey press will be sent as designated.</p>

<p>The commands in this section are used to "moderate" games;
that is, control various game settings affecting deadlines,
press, etc. Usually, these commands are issued by a Master, who
is a non-participant in the game. However, the Judge also is
configured to run "unmoderated" games, in which any of the
players can change some of the game settings. Many Judges do not
allow unmoderated games, so check with the Judgekeeper before
attempting to start this type of game. The term "moderator" means
either a Master in a moderated game, or any player in an
unmoderated game.</p>

<p class="commandexplanation">Allows the moderator for a game to
assume the identity of a particular power. The power
specification may be spelled out or abbreviated. Any commands
following this will be interpreted as if they had been submitted
by the specified power; this allows a Master, for example, to
change a player's password or to submit orders for a power. As a
result, no Master-only commands (including another <span
class="Keywords">BECOME</span>) can follow a <span
class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The player for "power" will receive
a message from the Judge advising him that the Master used the
<span class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command and confirming all

not use any commands in the same message as a <span
class="Keywords">BECOME</span> that they wouldn't want the player
to see.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The <span
class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command is useful in a number of
situations. One use is to submit commands for a particular power
if, for example, the player for that power gets disconnected from
the network and calls the Master on the phone to give his
orders.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">(Note, however, that a Master can
submit orders for any unit in the game without using the <span
class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command. Orders for multiple units
can be specified on the same line, separated by commas or
semicolons; but you shouldn't mix orders for units belonging to
multiple powers on the same line. This technique is used in some
variants to allow the Master to manipulate the players' orders in
some way before entering them into the Judge. In other
situations, the <span class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command is
preferred, because otherwise the true owner of the power will not
receive the confirmation reply from the Judge. Also, the "orders
have been received" flag will <em>not</em> be set for a
particular power if their orders were submitted by the Master
without the <span class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command. It this
case, it may be necessary to use the <span class="Keywords"><a

<p class="commandexplanation">You can also use the <span

class="Keywords"><a href="#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a></span> for
a player, either because the player isn't clear on how to do it
themselves, or because their requested absence exceeds the
current <span class="Keywords"><a href="#SETMAXABSENCE">MAX
ABSENCE</a></span> setting. The <span class="Keywords">MAX
ABSENCE</span> setting does not apply to absences entered by the
Master using the <span class="Keywords">BECOME</span> command.
However, Masters should avoid approving unusually long delays
without the consent of the players (anything over two weeks is
generally considered "unusually long," although this depends on
the expectations of players in a particular game).</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">The <span

command is intended to go back one phase for the case where one
person's orders get messed up and need to be resubmitted. Orders
for intermediate turns that were skipped over should remain
intact, but those previous orders may wind up being meaningless
based on changes in the results of the reprocessed turn. Any
pending orders that existed will also be reprocessed so if they
were revised by hand the first time the replayed phase was
processed the revisions may get lost.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">Most Masters make it a policy never
to rollback a turn except to correct an adjudication error (which
is rare). If you do rollback a turn, you should immediately enter
the necessary corrections to orders and <span class="Keywords"><a

<h1><a id="configuringvariantgames"

Games</h1>
<p>The Judge is capable of adjudicating a wide variety of
variants of the standard Diplomacy game. Some of these are "rules
variants" using the standard map with modified rules
(<em>e.g.</em>, different types of units, different number of
powers, different starting positions, etc.). Other variants
include a different map as well as non-standard rules.</p>
<p>For a list of all variants currently supported by a particular
Judge, send the command "<span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON </a>? password XXX</span>" (where "XXX"
can be anything that is <em>not</em> a valid variant name). Most
variants have an "info" file that describes the variant, which
can be obtained by sending the command "<span class="Keywords"><a
href="#GET">GET</a> INFO.variant</span>", where "variant" is a
valid variant name.</p>
<p>The Judge also recognizes a few "variant options" that can be
combined with any variant (including the Standard "variant").
These also have their own INFO.option files (for example, "<span
class="Keywords">GET INFO.GUNBOAT</span>").</p>
<p>The variant can be specified either by including it in the
<span class="Keywords"><a href="#CREATE">CREATE</a></span>
command, see <a href="#creatingobservingand">section 4</a>, or by
using the following commands before the game starts.</p>

<p class="commandexplanation">If activated, the transform options

<p class="commandexplanation">"When" options:</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">MOVE</span>: 
Allows transformations in a move phase where permitted by the
"where" option. A unit that is ordered to transform is deemed to
be holding, and may receive support from other units to hold. If
the unit is dislodged, the order to transform fails. If a unit is
attacked but not dislodged, the result depends on the setting of
the Attack Transform option (see <span class="Keywords"><a
href="#SETATTACKTRANSFORM">SET [NO] ATTACK TRANSFORM</a></span>,
above).</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">BUILD</span>: 
Allows transformations in a build phase where permitted by the
"where" option. Because it may be possible for a player who
otherwise has no adjustments required to transform a unit in a
build phase, an automatic 'wait' is placed on the build phase if
this option is set.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">"Where" options:</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">HOME CENTER</span>:
Transformations are allowed during the specified phase only for
units on a player's home centers.</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">ONE CENTER</span>:
Transformations are allowed during the specified phase in any
center as long as the player owns at least one home center.</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">ANY CENTER</span>:
Transformations are allowed during the specified phase in any
center.</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">ANYWHERE</span>:
Transformations are allowed during the specified phase in any
land province (units can never transform at sea). However, wings
that are blockading may not transform during a build phase. Of
course, an army may not transform into a fleet unless it is in a
coastal province.</p>
<p class="indent1hang"><span class="Keywords">NONE</span>: No
transformations are allowed during the specified phase.</p>
<p class="commandexplanation">See <a
href="#moveretreatand">section 6.1</a> for the syntax of
transformation orders. Note, in particular, that the type of unit
to be transformed into must always be specified (because this
option can be used in games with Wing units).</p>

<p>Machiavelli&trade; is a complex variant of Diplomacy, set in
Renaissance Italy, that was commercially published by Battleline
Games and later acquired by Avalon Hill. Machiavelli games have a
variety of scenarios and optional rules that can be implemented
on the Judge. These commands can only be issued by a moderator
before the game starts. Get file 'info.machiavelli' for more
specific information on standard and optional rules for this
variant.</p>
