<h2><a name="introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<h3><a name="aboutthejudge">1.1 About the Judge</a></h3>
<p>This is a guide to using the Diplomacy&trade; Adjudicator,
better known as the <b>Judge</b>, an automated program for the
on-line play of the strategy game Diplomacy&trade;, published by
Hasbro, and many of its variants.</p>
<p>This manual only covers Judges using the "<b>njudge</b>"
software, distributed from the Njudge Project (see <a href=
"#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>). These are not the only computer
adjudicator programs in existence; you can get information about
others from the sources listed below. You can also play Diplomacy
on-line through human adjudicators, or by postal mail, or even
(believe it or not!) face-to-face.</p>
<p>Diplomacy played via e-mail has existed for almost as long as
e-mail has been available to the private consumer. There are
several groups, such as the AOL Diplomacy group, the
well-regarded CompuServe Diplomacy group, and the Cat23 group
that have organized to run games over the web not using the Judge
system. But it is the Judge system that defines a good portion of
the Internet hobby, and has probably influenced more of its
development than anything else. (There is also a system called
the "<b>DPJudge</b>", which has a WWW interface and uses
different software than the Ken Lowe judges, although it is an
outgrowth of the email Judge system. This manual does not cover
the DPJudge.)</p>
<p>The initial Judge code was written by Ken Lowe in the late
1980s as a project to test his understanding of the C programming
language. The code has since been and continues to be improved
upon by the hard work of several different programmers. Ken Lowe
also set up and acted as judgekeeper for the first Judge, USWA.
USWA carried the hobby for several years assisted by one or two
other Judges, until it folded, causing concern that the Judge
hobby would die with it. Fortunately, though, other hobbyists
came through and set up Judges. At this writing, there are over a
dozen public judges in operation world-wide, including several
for non-English-speaking players.</p>
<p>Each Judge is operated independently by a volunteer
administrator, known as the <b>Judgekeeper</b>, and is identified
by a four-letter code (such as "USWA" in the previous paragraph).
At the moment, each Judge is a completely autonomous system.
Users must register with each Judge separately, and communicate
with each Judge separately. In particular, different Judges may
be running different versions of the <b>njudge</b> software, so
commands that work on one Judge will not necessarily work on all
others. Where possible, this manual will indicate the software
version in which each command was introduced.</p>
<p>Finally, using the Judge requires some knowledge of the rules
of Diplomacy. The Diplomacy rules themselves are copyrighted by
Hasbro, and are available (at this writing) at <a href=
"http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF">http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF</a>.
However, this manual does not cover either the rules or the
strategy of Diplomacy.</p>
<h3><a name="aboutthismanual">1.2 About this Manual</a></h3>
<p>This document is called the User's Manual because it is
designed for users, not for system administrators. This manual is
intended as a useful reference for anyone who masters, plays in,
or observes games on a Judge. However, new users may find it
easier to start with the introductory Guide to the Judge,
available by sending the command "<a class="plaintext" href=
"#GET">GET guide</a>" in a message to the Judge.</p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to list all the commands that
users may send to the Judge, provide examples of proper and
improper usage of the commands, and explain what kinds of errors
may occur and how to fix them. It is <i>not</i> a guide to how to
play the game of Diplomacy. <a href="#wheretofind">Section
1.3</a> lists many useful resources for players on strategy,
tactics, variants, and other game-related information.</p>
<h4><a name="howinformationis">1.2.1 How Information is Presented
in this Manual</a></h4>
<p>The following chapters of this manual include examples of
commands to the Judge. To make the examples clearer, they will
always be displayed in a distinctive style. Commands to send to
the Judge will appear like this:</p>
<p class="plaintext">GET filename</p>
<p>Words shown in ALL CAPS, like "<span class=
"plaintext">GET</span>" in the example above, are <b>keywords</b>
that should be typed exactly as they appear. Words shown in lower
case, like "<span class="plaintext">filename</span>" in the
example, are placeholders that you replace with specific
information (in this example, the name of a file you want the
Judge to send you). The use of upper and lower case in these
examples is only for the purpose of distinguishing between
keywords and non-keywords; the actual commands can be typed in
either upper- or lower-case (with one exception; see <a href=
"#thedeadlinesystem">section 5.1</a>).</p>
<p>Also, the Judge generally ignores spacing between keywords,
so, for instance, "<a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETWAIT">SET NOWAIT</a>" works just as well as "<span class=
"plaintext">SET NO WAIT</span>" or even "<span class=
"plaintext">SETNOWAIT</span>". (But inserting spaces inside a
keyword, like "<span class="plaintext">SET N O WAIT</span>", will
cause an error!) This was not always true on versions before
1.4.0, so if a multi-word command that looks right, like "<a
class="plaintext" href="#IAMALSO">I AM ALSO</a>", causes a
mysterious error message, try the same command without spaces
(<span class="plaintext">IAMALSO</span>) and see if it works that
way.</p>
<p>Items in square brackets are optional. Words separated by
vertical bars (|) indicate a choice of one of the words. Again,
these symbols are only shown to explain the proper syntax. Users
do not type in the square brackets or vertical bars!</p>
<p>Most command options are self-explanatory. "<span class=
"plaintext">name</span>" means the name of a game, which must be
no more than 8 alphanumeric characters. "<span class=
"plaintext">email</span>" means a valid email address. "<span
class="plaintext">power</span>" means the name (not just the
first letter) of one of the powers in the game, which depends on
the variant being played. The letter "<span class=
"plaintext">p</span>" will be used where the initial of a power
is required.</p>
<p><b>Caution:</b> whenever any setting is described in this
manual as the "default," that means only that it is set that way
in the software as provided from <a href=
"http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a> - however,
any Judgekeeper can change the default for games created on his
system, and Masters can change those defaults for individual
games. When in doubt, check the game listing (see <a class=
"plaintext" href="#LIST">LIST</a>, <a href=
"#gameinformationcommands">section 3.4</a>) to see what settings
are actually in effect.</p>
<p>A number in braces {like this} in the right-hand margin after
the command definition (or in the left-hand margin in some
browers) indicates the first Judge version number in which the
command appeared. If this number is absent, then the command is
believed to be available in all currently used Judge versions
(although this has not been verified). [Note: some commands
marked as version {0.8.9} may actually have been introduced in
versions 0.8.8 or 0.8.7, but this makes no real difference since
no public Judge is running either of those two versions at this
time.] There are also a few Judges running customized software
not based on the <b>njudge</b> code; these Judges are unlikely to
accept the commands shown with a version number in this Manual.
To find which Judges are running which versions of the software,
see <a href=
"http://gem.win.co.nz/judge/judgevers.html">http://gem.win.co.nz/judge/judgevers.html</a>.</p>
<p>Examples that illustrate an entire email communication with
the Judge will be shown as illustrated below, but will not follow
the upper- and lower-case convention discussed above:</p>
<p class="example">To: usxx@judgesite.com<br>
Subject: Help Me Please<br>
<br>
sign on rhappy password<br>
press to m<br>
Please help me! I don't know what I'm doing!<br>
endpress<br>
sign off</p>
<p>Finally, examples of responses from the Judge will be shown as
in the following illustration (most mail headers have been
omitted in the interest of clarity):</p>
<p class="judgesays">From: &lt;usxx@judgesite.com&gt;<br>
To: &lt;player@address.com&gt;<br>
Subject: USXX:happy - F1905M Deadline Adjustment to: Fri Feb 14
2003 23:30:00 -0500<br>
Date: Tuesday, February 11, 2003 3:11 PM<br>
<br>
All unmoderated games will be removed.<br>
Judge address is usxx@judgesite.com<br>
New Registrations will be reviewed for completeness and<br>
removed without notice if determined incomplete.<br>
<br>
master@domain.tld as Master set the deadline<br>

<h2><a name="introductiontothe">2. Introduction to the
Judge</a></h2>
<h3><a name="quickstartfor">2.1 Quick Start for New
Users</a></h3>
<p>If you have never used the Judge before, don't worry - you
don't have to read this entire Manual before you start playing.
However, there are some basics you need to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read sections <a href="#aboutthejudge">1.1</a>, <a href=
"#communicatingwiththe">2.2</a>, <a href="#whatdoi">2.3</a>, and
<a href="#thesinglemost">3.1</a> so that you understand what the
Judge is, what it does, and what it doesn't do.</li>
<li>Read <a href="#wheretofind">section 1.3</a> and take a look
at the various resources listed there. Especially, check out the
Judge Openings List and the Game Queue page, if you want to find
a game that you can join quickly.</li>
<li>Read about the <a class="plaintext" href=
"#REGISTEREND">REGISTER</a> command in <a href=
"#playerinformationand">section 3.3</a>. Then, when you are ready
to play, you can register on the Judge that is hosting your
game.</li>
<li>Read about the <a class="plaintext" href="#SIGNON">SIGN
ON</a> command in <a href="#creatingobservingand">section 4</a>.
You will need to use this to join a game.</li>
<li>If you are joining a new game, rather than taking over a
replacement position, then you will probably want to use the <a
class="plaintext" href="#SETPREFERENCE">SET PREFERENCE</a>
command in <a href="#generalcommands">section 7.1</a>.</li>
<li>Read <a href="#thedeadlinesystem">section 5.1</a> so that you
understand how deadlines are set, and why it is important to pay
attention to them.</li>
<li>If you have played Diplomacy face-to-face or in other
settings, you probably already know how to write your orders, but
you might want to review <a href="#moveretreatand">section
6.1</a> to see what formats the Judge will accept. You should
definitely read <a href="#convoyroutesmust">section 6.2</a>, too,
because sooner or later you are going to be involved in a convoy
order.</li>
<li>Finally, skim through <a href="#otherplayercommands">section
7</a> to see other commands that you might need to use during a
game. The most important ones to understand are <a class=
"plaintext" href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a>, <a class="plaintext"
href="#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a>, and the <a class="plaintext"
href="#PRESS">PRESS</a> commands in <a href=
"#presscommands">section 7.4</a>. Don't worry about "color
options" and "fake options" at this point; just read the basics
about how to send a press message to one or more other players,
including the "delivery options" section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the Judge itself provides a more extensive guide for
new users. Send an e-mail message to your favorite Judge (running
version 1.4.0 or higher) containing the line "<span class=
"plaintext"><a href="#GET">GET</a> GUIDE</span>" in the body.</p>
<h3><a name="communicatingwiththe">2.2 Communicating with the
Judge</a></h3>
<p>The Judge is an <b>e-mail based</b> system. All communications
to and from the Judge are sent by e-mail. There is no direct WWW
access to a Judge, although Judge information can be retrieved
and viewed through several WWW sites. In order to use a Judge,
therefore, you must have e-mail access and you must obtain the
e-mail address of a Judge (see <a href="#wheretofind">section
1.3</a>).</p>
<p>It is <i>highly recommended</i> that you use a mail program or
system that allows you to send plain-text messages (also known as
ASCII or Unformatted Text in some software), as the Judge cannot
process any messages that contain HTML tags, MIME encoding, or
other non-text commands. However, most problems with formatted
mail can be avoided by religious use of the <a class="plaintext"
href="#SIGNOFF">SIGN OFF</a> command (see <a href=
"#thesinglemost">section 3.1</a>).</p>
<p>If the Judge is functioning correctly, it should send a reply
to every e-mail message sent to it. The reply is ordinarily sent
to the address found in the <i>last</i> Reply-to: header
contained in the received mail message. Usually this will be the
same address that your message was sent from, but some users may
wish to receive the Judge replies at a different address. You may
be able to change your Reply-to address using your mail software;
alternatively, however, you can simply type a return address at
the beginning of your message, using the following format:</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">REPLY-TO:
username@domain.tld</span></p>
<p>If you are getting unwanted duplicate replies from the Judge,
see <a class="plaintext" href="#SETADDRESS">SET ADDRESS</a> in <a
href="#generalcommands">section 7.1</a>.</p>
<p>Commands to the Judge are entered in the body of the mail
message. The Judge does not process the subject line, but does
echo it back in its reply so that you can easily tell which reply
corresponds to which outgoing message.</p>
<h3><a name="whatdoi">2.3 What Do I Do If the Judge is
Down?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, it does happen sometimes: you send a message to the
Judge, and no reply comes back; or, a deadline goes by but you
receive no results, no late notice, nothing at all. There can be
a couple of explanations for this.</p>
<p>It could mean (a) the Judge is down, in which case it will
usually process your message when it comes back up; (b) your mail
didn't reach the Judge in the first place, which could be due to
a problem with your ISP or some intermediate system in the
Internet mail relay system; or (c) the Judge did send you a
message but you didn't receive it for one of the reasons
suggested in (b). Some "anti-spam" programs have been known to
falsely identify particular Judges as spam senders and block mail
messages from them without warning. If this happens to you, you
can either complain to your ISP or find another ISP for sending
and receiving email.</p>
<p>A good way to check whether the problem is with your email or
with the Judge is to view the Judge Openings List (see <a href=
"#wheretofind">section 1.3</a>), which will report the last time
each Judge's listing was updated. If your Judge's time is not
about the same as all the others', then there is something wrong
with the Judge. At this point, the Judgekeeper will already have
been sent an email from the Openings List alerting him to the
problem, so there is no need for you to contact him directly. You
may also wish to check the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup to see
if there is any announcement about the Judge's status.</p>
<p>If the Judge is down, <i>don't</i> continue to send mail to
it; wait until it responds to the messages you have already sent.
At best, sending repeated messages will flood your inbox with a
huge volume of replies when the Judge revives, and may delay
processing of games. At worst, you may end up having the wrong
commands recorded, because the Judge may not receive your
messages in the same order as you sent them. The best thing to do
is just wait until the Judge is restored, even though this can be
nerve-wracking for some people. You may be recorded as "late" if
a deadline expires during the time the Judge is down, but any
Master will surely forgive such an offense, and if it is an
isolated incident then the effect on your dedication ratings will
be minimal.</p>
<p>If you are a Master and the Judge goes down for an extended
period, it is usually best to wait until it is restored before
trying to "fix" any problems. If you send commands to change
deadlines, for example, the Judge may process the pending turn
before it gets to your <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETDEADLINE">SET DEADLINE</a> command, so that you could
inadvertently change the deadline for the <i>next</i> phase. One
thing that you can do while the Judge is down, however, is to
send a <a class="plaintext" href="#SETLIST">SET NO LIST</a>
command if your game is public. If the deadline and grace period
should expire during the outage, this will prevent the game from
being listed publicly, and prevent any of your players' positions
from being taken over by a replacement. Once the Judge is
restored, you can then set an appropriate new deadline.</p>
<h3><a name="dateformats">2.4 Date Formats</a></h3>
<p>Several Judge commands involve the use of dates. The Judge
accepts dates from users only in a few specific formats. If you
are using a Judge that has been modified to accept non-English
commands, you should check with the Judgekeeper to determine
whether the date strings have also been changed.</p>
<p>Dates may include one or more of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A weekday, which must be one of these three-letter
abbreviations:<br>
 
<div class="plaintext" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1em">SUN | MON | TUE |
WED | THU | FRI | SAT</div>
</li>
<li>A month, which must be one of these three-letter
abbreviations:<br>
 
<div class="plaintext" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1em">JAN | FEB | MAR |
APR | MAY | JUN | JUL | AUG | SEP | OCT | NOV | DEC</div>
</li>
<li>A day of the month (a number from 1 to 31, inclusive),
optionally followed by a comma;</li>
<li>A four-digit year</li>
<li>A numeric time using the 24-hour clock format "hh:mm"</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, these elements may appear in any order. So, for
example, "<span class="plaintext">Jun 15 23:30</span>" and "<span
class="plaintext">23:30 15 Jun</span>" are equivalent (and, for
that matter, "<span class="plaintext">Jun 23:30 15</span>" works
too, even though this syntax makes no sense to humans).</p>
<p>If the weekday is used, then the month and numeric day may not
be used. The weekday is converted into the next date (after the
current date) that falls on that day of the week. So, if today is
a Tuesday, "<span class="plaintext">Tue</span>" refers to the day
one week from today.</p>
<p>If no year is specified, the current year is assumed
<i>unless</i> the month specified is earlier than the current
month and is no more than six months away; in that case, the
following year will be assumed. So, if it is currently December,
"<span class="plaintext">10 Jan</span>" is assumed to refer to
the next year; but if it is currently February, the same date
will be assumed to refer to a date in the past.</p>
<p>If a day number but no month is specified, the next date with
that day number will be used. If today is June 1, then "<span
class="plaintext">15</span>" without any month will be assumed to
refer to June 15. If today is June 20, however, the same command
will refer to July 15.</p>
<p>If a month but no day is specified, the first day of the month
will be assumed, unless it is the current month, in which case
the current day will be assumed.</p>
<p>If no weekday, month, day, or year is specified, the current
day is assumed (except for the <a class="plaintext" href=
"#HISTORY">HISTORY</a> command, see <a href=
"#gameinformationcommands">section 3.4</a>).</p>
<p>If no time is specified, a default time will be assumed, which
depends on the specific command being executed.</p>
<p>All dates and times are based on the clock settings of the
computer system that the Judge is running on; usually, this is
the local time zone of the Judge system.</p>
<p>Dates are used in the commands: <a class="plaintext" href=
"#HISTORY">HISTORY</a>, <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a>, <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETDEADLINE">SET DEADLINE</a>, <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETGRACE">SET GRACE</a>, <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETSTART">SET START</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="userregistrationand">3. User Registration and
Administrative Commands</a></h2>
<p>Before you can join or observe a game on a Judge, you must be
a registered user of the Judge. There are a few commands,
however, that anyone can use even if they are not registered
(obviously, one of these is the command to register
yourself).</p>
<h3><a name="thesinglemost">3.1 The Single Most Important Judge
Command</a></h3>
<p>In this manual, <b>the last shall be first</b>; thus, we begin
with the <i>last</i> command that should appear in every message
you send to a Judge:</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SIGNOFF">SIGN OFF</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Indicates the end of commands in a message
to the Judge. This prevents your signature file (or taglines
inserted by your e-mail provider) from being interpreted as
orders and/or being sent out as part of a press message. If this
command is not used, the Judge will attempt to parse all
characters in the mail message until the end of the file is
reached. You should develop a habit of including this line at the
end of <i>every</i> message you send to the Judge.</p>
<h3><a name="userhelpcommands">3.2 User Help Commands</a></h3>
<p class="command"><a name="GET">GET file</a><br>
<a name="SEND">SEND [ME] file</a></p>
<p class="level1text">The Judge will send the file 'file' by
return mail. In the rest of this document, single quotes will be
used to signify the names of help files.</p>
<p class="level1text">Get file 'flist' for a complete list of
available files. Get file 'info' for a description of the more
important files. Both of these files are included in the new user
package, which you can retrieve with the next command:</p>
<p class="command"><a name="GETPACKAGE">GET PACKAGE</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Get the new user package of files. These
files are generally sent automatically to new users at the time
they register with a Judge (see command <a class="plaintext"
href="#REGISTEREND">REGISTER</a> in <a href=
"#playerinformationand">section 3.3</a>), but they can be
specifically requested with this command. These files are the
ones that all new users should read before attempting any Judge
Diplomacy games.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="HELP">HELP</a></p>
<p class="level1text">The file 'info' is sent by return mail, and
any other text following this line in the email message is
ignored. This is equivalent to <span class="plaintext"><a href=
"#GET">GET</a> INFO</span> followed by <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SIGNOFF">SIGN OFF</a>. <b>Exception</b>: If this command
appears <i>after</i> a <a class="plaintext" href="#SIGNON">SIGN
ON</a> or equivalent command (see <a href=
"#creatingobservingand">section 4</a>), then the Judge will
process additional text following the <span class=
"plaintext">HELP</span> command.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="VERSION">VERSION [level]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Retrieve the current version of the Judge
software. The optional <span class="plaintext">level</span>
specification is not currently used, but in some future version
may generate a log of changes since the specified version.</p>
<h3><a name="playerinformationand">3.3 Player Information and
Registration Commands</a></h3>
<p class="command"><a name="GETDEDICATION">GET DEDICATION</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Equivalent to <a class="plaintext" href=
"#INFOPLAYER">INFO PLAYER</a> (see below) for the address of the
user sending the command. (Note: before version 1.0.0, returned
only the player's numerical dedication rating.)</p>
<p class="command"><a name="GETWHOIS">GET WHOIS</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Retrieve the entire registration database
(this command may be disabled by the Judgekeeper, and is disabled
on many Judges). See <a class="plaintext" href="#WHOIS">WHO
IS</a>, below, to retrieve registration data for one or more
users.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="IAMALSO">I AM ALSO email</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Associate the existing registration
information for <span class="plaintext">email</span> (which must
be an email address that is <i>already registered</i> with this
Judge) with the new mail address from which this command is sent.
If your return address changes, you can use this command to tell
the Judge that you are the same person without having to resubmit
a complete form. You must send this command <i>from</i> the
<i>new</i> address, and use your <i>old</i> address in the <span
class="plaintext">email</span> position.</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{1.0.0}</span><a
name="INFOPLAYER">INFO PLAYER email</a></p>
<p class="level1text">The Judge will send the current player data
information (games played, deadlines missed, positions abandoned,
etc.) for the given e-mail address. See <a href=
"#dedicationsystems">section 5.2</a> for an explanation of the
dedication statistics contained in this information. (Unlike <a
class="plaintext" href="#WHOIS">WHO IS</a>, below, this command
requires a <i>complete</i> email address.)</p>
<p class="command"><a name="REGISTEREND">REGISTER ... END</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Register as a Judge user. Only registered
users may join or create games. Optionally, users can register on
many Judges by using the Web form at <a href=
"http://devel.diplom.org/Email/registration.html">http://devel.diplom.org/Email/registration.html</a>,
rather than using this command.</p>
<p class="level1text">This is a multi-line command. The first
line must be "<span class="plaintext">REGISTER</span>" and the
last line must be "<span class="plaintext">END</span>"; all lines
in-between are in the form "<span class="plaintext">field:
value</span>". To see the specific fields included in the
registration database, get file 'form'. This file contains a
template that users can edit and send back to the Judge.</p>
<p class="level1text">The default house rules (get file
'house.rules') require that all users provide, at a minimum, a
correct Name (first and last) Address (containing at least city
and state/province/postal code), Country, Email address and
Level. (The Level field must have one of the following values:
Novice, Amateur, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert. See <a class=
"plaintext" href="#SETLEVELANY">SET LEVEL</a>, <a href=
"#thedeadlinesystem">section 5.1</a>.) Moderators of particular
games may have additional requirements.</p>
<p class="level1text">If the field "<span class=
"plaintext">package: yes</span>" is included in the registration,
the Judge will send the new user package of files (see <a class=
"plaintext" href="#GETPACKAGE">GET PACKAGE</a>, <a href=
"#userhelpcommands">section 3.2</a> ).</p>
<p class="level1text">The registration information is associated
with the mail address from which it is received. (See <a href=
"#introductiontothe">section 2</a>.) A user may update his/her
registration data at any time by sending a new <span class=
"plaintext">REGISTER</span> command from the same mail address.
(Important: changing the Email field in your registration does
not change the address the Judge will reply to, or associate your
registration with that email address. To associate your existing
registration with a new address, use <a class="plaintext" href=
"#IAMALSO">I AM ALSO</a>, above. To receive Judge messages at a
different address, use <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETADDRESS">SET ADDRESS</a>, <a href="#generalcommands">section
7.1</a>.)</p>
<p class="command"><a name="WHO">WHO email [email ...]</a><br>
<a name="WHOIS">WHO IS email [email ...]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Retrieve registration information for
particular players. Each can be either a complete or partial
address; all registered mail addresses that start with the
characters matching <span class="plaintext">email</span> will be
listed. For example, the command "<span class="plaintext">WHO IS
m</span>" will list all users who have an email address that
starts with "m". However, <span class="plaintext">email</span>
cannot be omitted entirely. This command sends the user's
complete registration form (which can be used as a template for a
new or revised registration).</p>
<h3><a name="gameinformationcommands">3.4 Game Information
Commands</a></h3>
<p>Note: each of the following commands (except "<a class=
"plaintext" href="#MAP">MAP *</a>") may be used after signing on
to a particular game, without the "<span class=
"plaintext">name</span>" specification, to receive information
about the signed-on game.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="HISTORY">HISTORY name [FROM date] [TO
date] [LINES n]</a><br>
HISTORY name EXCLSTART turnId [EXCLEND turnId] [BROAD]</p>
<p class="level1text">Retrieve (by email) history information for
the specified game. The history information is all the messages
that an observer would have seen had he been signed on for the
time period. This includes turn results, broadcast press, and
informational notices (deadline adjustments, late notices, etc.),
but <i>not</i> any partial press. You may find it easier to
retrieve this information from Alain T&eacute;sio's exceptional
"Diplomacy tools" site, <a href=
"http://www.floc.net/">http://www.floc.net/</a>. (Note: the
history is not available in unfinished Blind games, except to a
Master.)</p>
<p class="level1text">The command "<span class=
"plaintext">HISTORY name</span>" without any other arguments will
retrieve all history for the period from one week ago (real time)
to the present, up to a maximum of 1000 lines. Other command
specifications can be used to change the time period covered and
the length of the response, as follows:</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">(Syntax
1)</span></p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">HISTORY name [FROM
date] [TO date] [LINES n]</span></p>
<p class="level2text">This form retrieves the history information
for the specified game ("name") for the specified time period (in
real time rather than game time). For the valid "<span class=
"plaintext">date</span>" formats, see <a href=
"#dateformats">section 2.4</a>. If "<span class="plaintext">FROM
date</span>" is omitted, the start of the period is the current
system time minus 7 days. If "<span class="plaintext">TO
date</span>" is omitted, the end of the period is the current
system time. If a date is specified but does not include a time
of day, the time period begins or ends at midnight on the
specified date.</p>
<p class="level2text">To get the earliest part of the history (or
the whole history), use a date that is known to be earlier than
the game start date. 1 Jan 1990 (or Jan 1, 1990) is usually
sufficient for this purpose.</p>
<p class="level2text">The "<span class="plaintext">lines</span>"
option can be used to limit (or increase) the number of lines
that will be returned by the adjudicator. The default is
1000.</p>
<p class="level2text">Examples:</p>
<p class="example">history foo from Jan 1, 2003</p>
<p class="level2text">This will return history of game "foo"
starting at midnight on Jan 1, 2003, up to the end of the records
(the present date) or 1000 lines, whichever comes first.</p>
<p class="example">history foo from Jan 1, 1990 to Dec 31, 2002
23:59 lines 5000</p>
<p class="level2text">This will return history of game "foo" from
the start of the game up to a minute before midnight on Dec 31,
2002, or 5000 lines, whichever comes first.</p>
<p class="example">history foo to Dec 31, 2002 23:59</p>
<p class="level2text">This will <i>not</i> perform as expected -
if the start date is not specified, it defaults to the current
system time minus seven days. Since the end date is before the
start date, it will be ignored. Therefore, this command will
produce the same results as "<span class="plaintext">HISTORY
foo</span>" with no arguments.</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">(Syntax
2)</span></p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">HISTORY name
EXCLSTART turnId [EXCLEND turnId] [BROAD]</span></p>
<p class="level2text">Retrieves the history information for the
specified game excluding specific phases. The keyword "<span
class="plaintext">EXCLSTART</span>" is not optional. The returned
history contains turns from start of game to (but not including)
the <span class="plaintext">EXCLSTART</span> turn, and (if
specified) from the <span class="plaintext">EXCLEND</span> turn
to the end of the stored history.</p>
<p class="level2text">The format for <span class=
"plaintext">'turnId'</span> is: SYYYYP where:</p>
<p class="level2hang">S - the season (ex: 'S' for Spring, or 'F'
for Fall) (some variants may have other seasons)</p>
<p class="level2hang">Y - each digit in the game year. (e.g.,
1901, 1425, 1999)</p>
<p class="level2hang">P - Phase (e.g., 'M' for Movement Phase,
'B' for builds, 'R' for Retreats)</p>
<p class="level2text">Some examples of valid <span class=
"plaintext">turnIDs</span>:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3em"><span class="plaintext">S1902M</span>
(Spring 1902 Movement Phase)</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3em"><span class="plaintext">F1999B</span>
(Fall 1999 Adjustment (Builds) Phase)</p>
<p class="level2text">No checking is done to determine whether
the <span class="plaintext">turnIDs</span> given are actually
found in the game. The default action for erroneous <span class=
"plaintext">turnIds</span> is to return a history for the entire
game. If the <span class="plaintext">EXCLSTART turnID</span> is
invalid, the <span class="plaintext">EXCLEND turnID</span> will
be ignored.</p>
<p class="level2text">Examples (assuming that "foo" is a Standard
game):</p>
<p class="example">history foo exclstart S9999M</p>
<p class="level2text">Returns the complete history.</p>
<p class="example">history foo exclstart S1903M</p>
<p class="level2text">Returns the history for game-years 1901 and
1902 only.</p>
<p class="example">history foo exclstart S1899M exclend
F1905B</p>
<p class="level2text">Returns the history from game-year 1906 to
the end of the records.</p>
<p class="level2text">By default, this version of the command
retrieves only phase results. However, if a draw notice is found
outside the excluded set of phases, the draw notice will be
included.</p>
<p class="level2text">The optional "<span class=
"plaintext">BROAD</span>" specifier will cause broadcasts and
other notices to be included in the history. In the worst case,
with the <span class="plaintext">BROAD</span> command, the
returned message can be anywhere from 200 Kb to as much as 1 Mb.
(<b>Beware</b> using this flag!)</p>
<p class="command"><a name="LIST">LIST [FULL|name]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Retrieve the current status of the
specified game, including players, unit positions and supply
center holdings. (Among other things, this can be useful to
determine which players are late in sending their orders at a
particular time.) If the command <span class=
"plaintext">LIST</span> without a name is given <i>before</i>
signing on to a game, the Judge sends a short list of all current
games. The <span class="plaintext">LIST FULL</span> version sends
a detailed report including the player list of each game.</p>
<p class="command">MAP name [N]</p>
<p><i>[Deprecated: this command is disabled by default on new
Judges, although the Judgekeeper can enable it. It may not be
supported in future versions.]</i></p>
<p class="level1text">Retrieve a postscript map of the current
status of the game. Not all variants are supported. The "<span
class="plaintext">N</span>" option sends the file in plain
postscript format instead of uuencoded, compressed ps format.
Rather than use this command, you can obtain maps of any game in
multiple formats from Alain T&eacute;sio's outstanding "Diplomacy
tools" site, <a href=

<p class="command"><a name="MAP">MAP * [N]</a></p>
<p><i>[Deprecated: see previous entry.]</i></p>
<p class="level1text">This command must be followed by a <a

<h2><a name="deadlinesanddedication">5. Deadlines and Dedication
(or, Get Your Orders in on Time!)</a></h2>
<h3><a name="thedeadlinesystem">5.1 The Deadline System</a></h3>
<p>The Judge system administers deadlines for all games. Unless
otherwise specified, orders will be processed on the following
schedule. These default settings may be changed by the
Judgekeeper, and may be further changed for individual games by a
Master, or by any player in an unmoderated game.</p>
<pre>
Move    clock 1410 min 12.00 next 71.00 grace 167.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
Retreat clock   -1 min  0.00 next 23.00 grace  71.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
Adjust  clock   -1 min  0.00 next 23.00 grace  71.00 delay 0.50 days -MTWTF-
</pre>
<p>Each value goes with the keyword <i>before</i> it, not after.
(So the first line means "clock 1410"; "min 12.00"; etc. -
<i>not</i> "clock 1410 min" or "12.00 next".) The meanings of the
various settings are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>clock</b></dt>
<dd>If non-negative, indicates the minutes past midnight to which
the new deadline will be set. 1410 is eleven thirty pm. If
negative, this parameter is ignored, and the new deadline is set
at exactly "next" hours after the time the previous phase was
processed.</dd>
<dt><b>min</b></dt>
<dd>Indicates the minimum number of hours that can elapse between
the previous phase and the new phase. Thus, in the above example,
there will be at least 12 hours after a build or retreat phase
before the movement orders will be processed. This parameter has
no real use other than to prevent a runaway situation if all of
the powers in a game were to go CD.</dd>
<dt><b>next</b></dt>
<dd>Indicates the number of hours after the previous phase is
processed that the new deadline will be set. This may be
increased to fit into the values of the 'clock' and/or 'days'
parameters. In the default case, movement orders are three days
after the previous phase. However, because of the "clock"
setting, the deadline will be advanced to 11:30 p.m. on the third
day; and, because of the "days" setting, if the third day falls
on a weekend it will slide to Monday.</dd>
<dd>(<b>Note</b>: the "next" interval is specified as 71 hours,
rather than 72, because of the interaction between "next" and
"clock". The Judge does not process seasons instantaneously. If
the Spring 1901 phase is processed, for example, at 11:35 pm
Monday, then a "next 72.0" setting would require the next
deadline to be at 11:35 pm Thursday; but, since "clock" requires
that the deadline be exactly at 11:30 pm, this would push the
deadline forward to Friday.)</dd>
<dd>In any event, the next deadline should never be earlier than
the deadline from the most recently processed phase (thus, for
example, if the moderator manually extends the current deadline
for two weeks to allow for a player absence, but then the turn is
processed because the absent player was nice enough to submit
orders before he left, the next deadline will still be
approximately two weeks away). The only exception to this is if
the moderator manually resets the deadline to an earlier
time.</dd>
<dt><b>grace</b></dt>
<dd>Indicates the number of hours the adjudicator will wait after
the deadline expires if not everyone has gotten their orders in
yet. In the default case, a grace period of one week after the
initial deadline is allowed. When the deadline comes up, a
reminder message will be sent to everyone who hasn't gotten their
orders in and a notice will be sent to the other players and
observers in the game indicating who is late. Another reminder
will be sent to the late parties, and a notice to all other
participants, every day.</dd>
<dd>If the game is set "NoNMR" (the default), the Judge will wait
for orders until the end of the grace period. Then, a notice will
be sent to all players and observers in that game indicating that
the late power has been abandoned. Abandoned powers may be taken
over by anyone not already playing a power in the game merely by
signing on with any password. No orders will be processed until
the late power returns or is taken over.</dd>
<dd>If the game is set "NMR," the power will be deemed abandoned
if orders have not been received by 24 hours <i>before</i> the
end of the grace period. If you are running an NMR game,
therefore, your grace periods must be at least 24 hours and
normally should be at least 48. At the end of the grace period,
if complete orders still have not been received, either from the
original player or a replacement, the power will be declared in
"Civil Disorder" and the phase will be processed with incomplete
orders. On subsequent phases powers marked CD will not be
considered when deciding whether the deadline should slide. When
a valid <a class="plaintext" href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a> is
received, the CD and/or abandoned status will be cleared.</dd>
<dd>As with the deadline, the program should never set a grace
period that is earlier than the grace period from the last
processed season, although a moderator can change this
manually.</dd>
<dt><b>delay</b></dt>
<dd>Indicates the number of hours after the last required orders
have been received before the orders will be processed. The
default is 0.5 hours, so that if all powers get their orders in
before the deadline, the orders will be processed thirty minutes
later. This gives people a little time to change their mind after
orders are submitted.</dd>
<dt><b>days</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies which days of the week are valid for the setting of
the initial deadline. An uppercase letter indicates that that day
of the week is okay. If the letter is lowercase, then the
deadline is delayed until after noon. A dash indicates that the
deadline cannot fall on that day of the week. Unless the
"StrictGrace" flag has been set, the grace period also will be
extended to a day that is valid for the initial deadline.
<b>Warning</b>: this parameter is an exception to the general
rule that adjudicator commands are not case-sensitive!</dd>
</dl>
<p>These parameters can be changed by a moderator using the <span
class="plaintext">SET</span> command. For example:</p>
<p class="example">SET MOVES NEXT 48.0 DELAY 1.0<br>
SET BUILDS DELAY 1.0</p>
<p>These commands will (a) set the default move deadline to (at
least) 48 hours after the previous phase was processed, and (b)
require a one-hour delay after the last player submits (timely)
move and build orders before the turn can be processed. These
commands will not change the deadlines for the currently pending
phase. See <a href="#deadlinerelatedsettings">section
8.6</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, a moderator can use the following commands to
override the standard deadline settings for the current phase
only: <a class="plaintext" href="#SETDEADLINE">SET DEADLINE</a>;
<a class="plaintext" href="#SETGRACE">SET GRACE</a>; <a class=
"plaintext" href="#SETSTART">SET START</a>. See <a href=
"#deadlinerelatedsettings">section 8.6</a>.</p>
<p>Orders can be sent in any time before the deadline. If
multiple movement orders are received for the same unit, the most
recent one received will override the earlier one. Attempting to
build or remove too many units during the adjustment phase will
cause the earliest received build/remove requests to be ignored.
Thus you can send in preliminary movement or adjustment orders
immediately and then send in revised orders after you change your
mind from diplomatic talks. Beware, though, that if everyone gets
their orders in before the deadline, the orders may be processed
before you have a chance to get your revised orders in.</p>
<p>If you include a <a class="plaintext" href="#SETWAIT">SET
WAIT</a> command with your orders, you can avoid having your
orders processed before the deadline. When you've decided that
your orders are final, you can send in a message with a <span
class="plaintext">SET NO WAIT</span> command to allow the orders
to be processed as soon as the delay period expires and everyone
else has their orders in. Remember that <a class="plaintext"
href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a> is cleared when the orders are
processed, so you have to explicitly set it again (if you want
it) for each phase.</p>
<p>If the reply mail to any order indicates that there was an
error or you have a unit that you did not supply an order for or
you didn't explicitly specify all your builds, remove or
retreats, the flag indicating that your orders have been received
will not be set. Note that all builds must be specified or
explicitly <span class="plaintext">WAIVE</span>'d before the
adjudicator will consider your build orders complete, unless it
is impossible to build all units (<i>e.g.</i>, five supply
centers taken in a single year or no vacant home centers). An
error free set of orders will be required to set the "has
submitted orders" status. If no error free orders have been
received by the time the grace period expires in an "NMR" game,
the partial orders will be processed and the CD status will be
set for your power. See the discussion on grace periods above for
more info on what happens when you miss a deadline and taking
over abandoned powers.</p>
<h3><a name="dedicationsystems">5.2 Dedication Systems</a></h3>
<p>"Dedication" refers to a player's history of submitting moves
on time and playing each position out to the bitter end. Doing
this is <b>good</b>; sending orders late and abandoning your
position when the game is going against you are <b>bad</b>.
Playing Diplomacy is a group effort and can take quite a while to
complete (as you know if you've played face-to-face); nobody
wants to play with someone who just disappears in the middle of
the game.</p>
<p>The Judge tracks player dedication in three ways. System (1)
tracks all games ever played on the Judge (unless the Judgekeeper
has reset the data files). Systems (2) and (3), which are newer,
only track turns played since they were installed on the Judge
(which varies by Judge, but was no earlier than 2002).</p>
<p class="level1hang">(1) The original dedication system, which
has some flaws but is being maintained for continuity, is based
on a point system.  The default values, which like all Judge defaults can be changed by a particular Judgekeeper, are as follows:</p>
<p class="level2text">+3 points for getting your orders in on
time.</p>
<p class="level2text">-1 point for each "deadline missed"
reminder the judge sends you.</p>
<p class="level2text">-50 points for becoming abandoned.</p>
<p class="level2text">-100 points for missing the grace period
and going CD.</p>
<p class="level1text">There is no penalty for resigning before a
deadline, if you submit complete orders <i>before</i> you resign.
However, you will continue to receive the -1 point penalty every
day that your power remains abandoned after the deadline. If your
power goes CD after you've resigned without anyone else taking
the power over, you will receive the CD penalty as well (this is
to discourage you from resigning when you're down to a few units
which could be used to affect the final outcome of the game, but
you've just lost interest).</p>
<p class="level1hang">(2) The "ontime ratio" system. In this
system players are rated based on what percentage of their total
turns they have submitted on time. We use the following
formula:</p>
<pre>
                  Turns Submitted Ontime
         Rating = ----------------------
                     Total turns due 
</pre>
<p class="level1text">Therefore each player has a rating between
0.0 and 1.0, with higher rankings being better than lower
ones.</p>
<p class="level1hang">(3) The "CD ratio" system, which compares
the number of times a player has gone into Civil Disorder
(<i>i.e.</i>, failed to submit complete orders by the end of the
grace period, regardless of whether the game was NMR or not), to
the number of games he has started. We use the following
formula:</p>
<pre>
                             Times in Civil Disorder
         Rating = ----------------------------------------------
                  Games started + abandoned positions taken over 
</pre>
<p class="level1text">Again ratings range from 0.0 to 1.0, but in
this case lower ratings (fewer missed grace periods) are
preferable. (Actually, a player who is really sloppy about
deadlines could theoretically achieve a ratio above 1.0, but we
won't dwell on such an unhappy possibility.)</p>
<p>GMs or others creating games can restrict who is eligible to
sign on to the game based on dedication ratings, using the
commands <a class="plaintext" href="#SETDEDICATION">SET
DEDICATION</a>, <a class="plaintext" href="#SETONTIMERAT">SET
ONTIMERAT</a>, and <a class="plaintext" href="#SETRESRAT">SET

<h2><a name="enteringorders">6. Entering Orders</a></h2>
<h3><a name="moveretreatand">6.1 Move, Retreat, and Adjustment
Orders for the Current Phase</a></h3>
<p>Following a <a class="plaintext" href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a>
command, a player may submit orders for his power for the current
phase simply by typing those orders in the body of the mail
message. Multiple orders can be entered on one line by separating
them with commas or semicolons.</p>
<p>Most orders can be written the same way they are customarily
written in face-to-face games, using the abbreviations shown in
the Diplomacy rulebook. <b>Warning</b>: the syntax for convoys is
different than in the standard Diplomacy rules. See <a href=
"#convoyroutesmust">section 6.2</a>. Also, unlike standard
Diplomacy, the Judge does not require or permit you to specify
the power that owns a unit you are supporting or convoying. (So
you would just write "A Ven S A Tri" rather than "A Ven S
Austrian A Tri".) And, again unlike standard Diplomacy, the Judge
will not accept orders that are impossible or badly-written (like
A Par-Mun, or F Nth S Philadelphia-Boston), or for units that you
don't actually control. Instead, erroneous orders will raise the
"error flag," and orders will not be processed until the errors
are corrected.</p>
<p>If you have submitted any orders for the current phase, the
Judge will list these orders in its reply to every message you
send to it, until the phase is processed. It is <i>highly</i>
recommended that players check the orders in the Judge reply to
make sure their orders have been parsed as they intended, and to
make sure that all units have been ordered!</p>
<p>The following is an exhaustive list of the order syntax
recognized by the Judge. Some of these order formats may only be
used in variant games. Items in [square brackets] are
optional.</p>
<p>Movement orders:</p>

<p class="level1text"><b>Note</b>: "wing" units, "proxy" orders
and "transform" orders can only be used if the moderator has
enabled the corresponding variant setting.</p>
<p>Province names can be abbreviated or can be spelled out. Valid
abbreviations can be found in the 'map' file for the variant you
are playing (use the command "<span class="plaintext">GET
MAP</span>" for the standard map, or "<span class="plaintext">GET
map.xxx</span>" for variant map "xxx"). Coasts can be specified
by following the province name with one of the following:</p>
<div class="level1plain">
<div class="syntaxterm">&lt;coast&gt;</div>
<div class="syntaxdef">= "/nc", "(nc)", "/north coast", "(north
coast)"</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>replacing 'north' or 'n' with another valid direction if
appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Warning</b>: if you do not specify a coast for a fleet
moving to a destination province that contains coasts (including
an order to support such a move), the Judge will arbitrarily add
a coast to the order (namely, the first one on its list). This
may lead to unintended results!</p>
<p>Here are some examples of valid orders (assuming that the
player actually controls the units given in the orders):</p>
<p><b>Movement phase orders:</b></p>
<p class="example">A Ber -&gt; Kie<br>
A Ser m Rum<br>
Lon-Nth<br>
F Kiel moves to Berlin<br>
Par H<br>
F Rome Stands<br>
A MUN S F KIE-BER<br>
A Brest supports Paris<br>
F Sev S A Ser M Rum</p>
<p>Note that, as in the example "Lon-Nth", it is not necessary to
specify the unit type, but since Nth is a sea space the order
will be rejected if the unit in Lon is not actually a fleet.</p>
<p><b>Retreat phase orders:</b></p>
<p class="example">F Kiel m Den<br>
A Rum-Bul<br>
Par -&gt; Pic<br>
Mun disbands</p>
<p>As these examples show, retreats are written exactly like
movement orders, except when you are disbanding a unit.</p>
<p><b>Adjustment phase orders:</b></p>
<p class="example">build A Lon<br>
F StP/sc<br>
remove A Tun</p>
<p>The order for "F StP/sc" will be interpreted as either a build
or a removal, depending on whether the power has more supply
centers than units, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Note the difference between disband orders in a retreat phase,
and removal orders in an adjustment phase. In a retreat phase,
the word "disband" is required and comes <i>after</i> the unit
type and location; in an adjustment phase, the word "disband" or
"remove" is optional and, if used, comes <i>before</i> the unit
type and location.</p>
<p>Similarly, the syntax for transform orders (<i>which are used only in variant games</i>) depends on whether it is a movement or an adjustment phase.  In a move phase, the unit location comes first, followed by the transform command, then the new unit type.  In an adjustment phase, however, the transform command comes first, followed by the new unit type, then the location.  Examples (assuming, in each case, that the player currently has a fleet in Brest and an army in Spain, and that the current game settings permit the desired transformations):</p>
<p><b>Movement phase:</b></p>
<p class="example">F Brest transforms to Army<br>
Spain trafo F (sc)</p>
<p><b>Adjustment phase:</b></p>
<p class="example">Transform A Brest<br>
trafo f spa/sc</p>
<p>In both cases, the order will fail if the player does not specify the new unit type (because this command is supported in variants that recognize other unit types besides armies and fleets); however, specifying the old unit type is never required, and is not permitted in the adjustment phase.  The transformation of the army in Spain to a fleet will also fail unless the player specifies which coast the fleet is to be placed on.  Finally, please note that while transform orders can be abbreviated as "<span class="plaintext">trafo</span>", they cannot be abbreviated as "<span class="plaintext">t</span>" because that abbreviation is reserved for convoy orders.</p>
<p>Revisions to orders can be sent in any time before the phase
is processed. Orders may be processed before the deadline unless
the <a class="plaintext" href="#SETWAIT">SET WAIT</a> command has
been used (see <a href="#deadlinerelatedcommands">section 7.2</a>). The last valid order for a particular unit will be honored.
For Adjustment phases, if you submit more build orders than you
can use, the last one(s) received will be honored. If no valid
order is received for a particular unit in an NMR game, it will
be listed in the reports as "No order processed".</p>
<h3><a name="convoyroutesmust">6.2 Convoy Routes Must Be
Specified</a></h3>
<p>Unlike human adjudicators, the Judge requires that convoy
routes be specified. (Get file 'rules' for complete details on
differences between the Judge and the standard rules.) To do a
convoy, you must order each participating fleet to convoy the
army, and also must order the army to follow a specific convoy
route. For example:</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="75%" summary=
"Examples of correct and incorrect convoy ordering formats."
border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>

<th style=
"PADDING-LEFT: 3.5em; VERTICAL-ALIGN: top; TEXT-ALIGN: left; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">
WRONG</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="correct"><br>
A Lon-Nth-Nwy<br>
F Nth C A Lon-Nwy</td>
<td class="wrong"><br>
A Lon-Nwy<br>

<tr>
<td class="correct"><br>

A Bre-Mar<br>
F Mid C A Bre-Mar<br>
F Wes C A Bre-Mar<br>
F Lyo C A Bre-Mar</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>
<br>
<p>The "wrong" column is correct according to the standard rules
of Diplomacy and the usual practice in human-adjudicated games,
but on the Judge it will raise the error flag!</p>
<p>The convoying fleets do not have to belong to the same power
as the army, or as each other; but if the route specified for the
army does not match up exactly with the fleet orders, the convoy
will fail. As shown above, only the army has to specify the
entire route; the fleets only need to give the origin and
destination.</p>
<p>The Judge generally does not check the "reasonableness" of a
convoy order, because of the complexity of checking all possible
units along all possible convoy paths. Convoy orders will be
accepted as long as the convoying fleet and the convoyed army
actually exist, and the destination is a (land) province defined
in the map file, unless the optional StrictConvoy flag is set
(see <a href="#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a> ).</p>

<p class="level1text">Submit conditional orders. These statements
can only be used after a <a class="plaintext" href=
"#PHASE">PHASE</a> command; they cannot be used for the current

<p class="level1text">Conditions may be combined with the

parenthesis to change the precedence. The condition evaluates to
"true" if a unit of the specified type belonging to the specified
power is present (or not) in the specified province at the
beginning of the specified phase. The province must be specified,
but the type and power are optional and interpreted as "any" if
not specified. The power, type and province can be specified in
any order. Powers can be abbreviated to two or more characters or
spelled out. For example:</p>

<h2><a name="otherplayercommands">7. Other Player
Commands</a></h2>
<p>The commands in this section must follow a valid <a class=
"plaintext" href="#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a> command, and may be used
by any player. Unless otherwise noted, these commands are also
available to Masters. Observers may also use the <a class=
"plaintext" href="#SETADDRESS">SET ADDRESS</a>, <a class=
"plaintext" href="#SETPASSWORD">SET PASSWORD</a>, and <a class=
"plaintext" href="#RESIGN">RESIGN</a> commands, and any press
commands that have been enabled by the Master.</p>
<p>These commands will only affect the game for which the player
signed on in the same message. If, for example, you want to
change your password or return address in more than one game, you
need to send a separate message for each game.</p>
<h3><a name="generalcommands">7.1 General Commands</a></h3>
<p class="command"><a name="RESIGN">RESIGN</a><br>
<a name="WITHDRAW">WITHDRAW</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Withdraw from the game. This must be the
<i>last</i> command in the message to be effective; so if you
want to broadcast a farewell message, do so before you enter the
<span class="plaintext">RESIGN</span> command. A Master cannot
<span class="plaintext">RESIGN</span>. See command <a class=
"plaintext" href="#EJECT">EJECT</a>, <a href=
"#masteronlycommands">section 8.2</a>.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETADDRESS">SET ADDRESS
[email]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Change where your game reports go. If you
don't specify an address, the address from the mail headers
(specifically, the <i>last</i> Reply-To: header encountered) will
be used. If you sign on and the address in the mail headers does
not match the reporting address you will get two replies, one to
each address. This can be fixed by using <span class=
"plaintext">SET ADDRESS</span> with no reply address specified.
You can also specify multiple addresses separated by commas, but
no spaces, to receive reports at two (or more) addresses.
Example:</p>
<p class="example">SET ADDRESS email1,email2</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETPASSWORD">SET PASSWORD
new_password</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Change your password. Passwords must
contain only alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETPREFERENCE">SET PREFERENCE
list</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Record a preference list for power
assignment. May only be used before powers are assigned (of
course), and should appear immediately after an initial <span
class="plaintext">SIGN ON</span> when entering a forming game. A
player may indicate that he has an equal preference for two or
more powers by enclosing them in square brackets. For example,
"<span class="plaintext">SET PREFERENCE E[FGR][TAI]</span>" would
indicate that the player's first choice is England; after that,
he would prefer any of France, Germany, or Russia equally; and
after that would take any of the remaining powers. If the list is
a single asterisk ("<span class="plaintext">SET PREFERENCE
*</span>"), then a random power will be assigned if allowed by
the game settings (see <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETPRFBOTH">SET PRFBOTH</a>, <a href=
"#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a> ). If this command is
not used or the list is empty, the player will be assigned a
random power only <i>after</i> all players who have submitted
preferences have received their assignments (unless the game is
set to require random assignment for all powers, see <a class=

<p class="level1text">Request or cancel an absence period. Does
not affect the deadline for the current phase, but no subsequent
deadlines will be set during the absence period. Neither <span
class="plaintext">start_date</span> nor <span class=
"plaintext">end_date</span> can be before the current date. If
<span class="plaintext">end_date</span> is before <span class=
"plaintext">start_date</span>, the command will be ignored. If
<span class="plaintext">end_date</span> is omitted, an absence
period of 24 hours is assumed. If absences are overlaid, they
count as separate absences. However, Judge versions 1.4.0 and
higher will reject attempts to set overlapping absences.</p>
<p class="level1text">Observers and eliminated (inactive) players
cannot set absences. Masters can.</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">SET NO
ABSENCE</span> cancels one pending absence period. The <span
class="plaintext">end_date</span> is ignored. The first absence
found that includes <span class="plaintext">start_date</span> is
cancelled.</p>
<p class="level1text">Setting an absence never extends the
<i>current</i> deadline; it only takes effect when a turn is
processed, if the <i>next</i> deadline using the normal settings
would fall after <span class="plaintext">start_date</span>. A
player who is going away needs to either submit their orders for
the phase that is pending at <span class=
"plaintext">start_date</span> before they leave, pick a <span
class="plaintext">start_date</span> that is early enough so that
this won't be a problem, or ask the Master to extend the current
deadline. (Understandably, Masters may be unhappy if you choose
the last option.) It is also recommended (though not required)
that <span class="plaintext">start_date</span> and <span class=
"plaintext">end_date</span> be days on which deadlines normally
fall; for example, in a weekdays-only game, setting an absence to
start or end on a Saturday or Sunday may yield undesired
results.</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">Start_date</span>
and <span class="plaintext">end_date</span> may use any of the
date/time formats described in <a href="#quickstartfor">section
2.1</a>. Examples of valid date formats:</p>
<p class="example">set absence Jan 1 to Jan 15<br>
set absence 24 Jun to 3 Jul<br>
set absence Sat to Tue</p>
<p class="level1text">Note that the last example will not work if
it is sent on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, as the Judge will
interpret "Sat" as the following Saturday, and "Tue" as meaning
'this coming Tuesday', not 'Tuesday next week' as the player
seems to intend; the Judge will reject the absence because it
appears to end before it begins. It is therefore better in most
cases to specify the dates.</p>
<p class="level1text">Only a maximum of three (3) absences can be
pending at any given time for a single player. Once an absence
expires, however, it is removed from memory and its "slot"
becomes available for another request. If you need to change a
previously-set absence, first <span class="plaintext">use SET NO
ABSENCE</span> to remove the old one, then use <span class=
"plaintext">SET ABSENCE</span> to set the correct dates.
Otherwise, you will use up two of your slots.</p>
<p class="level1text">Each absence request will generate an
informative message to the Master, and he will also see the
pending future absences every time he sends a message for the
game (along with pending orders).</p>
<p class="level1text">If an absence request exceeds the game
limit (see command <a class="plaintext" href="#SETMAXABSENCE">SET
MAX ABSENCE</a> in <a href="#deadlinerelatedsettings">section
8.6</a> ), a message will be sent to the Master who must manually
activate the absence for it to take effect. Generally, the Master
should do this by using the <a class="plaintext" href=
"#BECOME">BECOME power</a> command (see <a href=
"#masteronlycommands">section 8.2</a> ) and setting the absence
for the player, as this allows the player to cancel or change the
absence later if desired. (Also, the Master, like each player,
has only three absence "slots," and might use them all up setting
absences for other players.) The <span class="plaintext">MAX
ABSENCE</span> setting is ignored if the absence is set by a
Master, even using <a class="plaintext" href=
"#BECOME">BECOME</a>.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETWAIT">SET [NO] WAIT</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Sets/clears the wait flag. If the Master or

<p class="level1text">Cast a vote for or against a concession (if
the moderator has enabled this command; see <a class="plaintext"
href="#SETCONCESSION">SET [NO] CONCESSION</a>, <a href=
"#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a>). Replace "p" with the
initial of the power you wish to concede to. Even though you may
only concede to the largest power on the board, the Judge
requires you to specify the power to be sure you really know to
whom you are conceding. <span class="plaintext">SET NO
CONCEDE</span> is only necessary to clear a previously-ordered
concession, since a concession can only be approved by unanimous
vote.</p>
<p class="level1text">Concessions are cleared every time orders
are processed, so you need to re-set a concession (if you still
want it) every phase.</p>
<p class="level1text">Note: The only valid forms of these
commands were "<span class="plaintext">SET [NO] CONC</span>"
until version 1.4.0, which added the "<span class="plaintext">SET
[NO] CONCEDE</span>" forms.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETDRAW">SET DRAW [powerlist]</a><br>
SET NO DRAW</p>
<p class="level1text">Cast a vote in an automated draw. The <span
class="plaintext">powerlist</span> option is only valid if the
game is set NoDIAS. Any draw vote, DIAS or NoDIAS, is good for
one phase only. All draw votes are cleared at the end of a phase,
so you need to cast your vote again every phase (if you still
want to agree to a draw). It is normally not necessary to use
<span class="plaintext">SET NO DRAW</span> unless you change your
mind in the middle of a phase, since no draw can be passed
without consent of all active players.</p>
<p class="level1text">The term "DIAS" means "Draws Include All
Survivors". By default, all games are DIAS. The moderator can
change this with the <span class="plaintext"><a href=
"#SETDIAS">SET [NO] DIAS</a></span> commands. See <a href=
"#standardgamemoderation">section 8.3</a>. In a DIAS game, a
surviving player cannot be excluded from a draw. In a NoDIAS
game, a surviving player may give up his right to be included in
a draw. In either case, unanimous approval of surviving players
is required for a draw to be passed.</p>
<p class="level1text">In a DIAS game, a player may cast his vote
for a draw by issuing the command <span class="plaintext">SET
DRAW</span>. He may withdraw earlier approval by issuing the
command <span class="plaintext">SET NO DRAW</span>. If at any
time all surviving players agree to a DIAS draw, the game will be
immediately terminated (without waiting for the next deadline),
and all participants in the game will be informed of the
result.</p>
<p class="level1text">The situation for NoDIAS games is a bit
more complex. To vote for a NoDIAS draw, a player issues the
command <span class="plaintext">SET</span> <span class=
"plaintext">DRAW powerlist</span>, where <span class=
"plaintext">powerlist</span> is a list of the identifiers for the
powers he wishes included in the draw. When a player gives
approval to <span class="plaintext">powerlist</span> and <span
class="plaintext">powerlist</span> includes his own power, he is
also implicitly approving any subset of <span class=
"plaintext">powerlist</span> that also includes his power. On the
other hand, when a player gives approval to <span class=
"plaintext">powerlist</span> and <span class=
"plaintext">powerlist</span> does <i>not</i> include his own
power, he is implicitly approving any subset of <span class=
"plaintext">powerlist</span>, <i>and</i> any subset of <span
class="plaintext">powerlist</span> plus his own power.</p>
<p class="level1text">For example, if Austria issued the command
<span class="plaintext">SET DRAW AEG</span>, he is approving the
draws AEG, AG, AE, or A. Note that by including himself in his
draw list, he is assuring that he cannot be excluded from a draw.
If Austria issues <span class="plaintext">SET DRAW A</span>, he
is accepting <i>any</i> draw as long as it includes him. If
Austria issues <span class="plaintext">SET DRAW FT</span>, he is
approving FT, F, T, AFT, AF, AT, or A.</p>
<p class="level1text">If, under these rules, more than one draw
is approved by all players, the draw including the most players
passes.</p>
<p class="level1text">In a NoDIAS game, <span class=
"plaintext">SET NODRAW</span> is equivalent to the command <span
class="plaintext">SET DRAW</span> x, where x is the power issuing
the command. This means that the player will only accept a
concession to himself.</p>
<p class="level1text">Here are a few examples of the NoDIAS draw
mechanism in action. The players listed are assumed to be the
only survivors.</p>
<p class="level2text">France: SET DRAW AEF<br>
England: SET DRAW AEF<br>
Austria: SET DRAW AEF<br>
Results in a three-way draw between Austria, England, and
France.</p>
<p class="level2text">France: SET DRAW AE<br>

<p class="level2text">France: SET DRAW AEF<br>
England: SET DRAW AE<br>
Austria: SET DRAW AE<br>

<p class="level2text">France: SET DRAW A<br>

after <span class="plaintext">PRESS</span> (to specify who will
receive the message), but not after <span class=

<p class="level1text">The types of press allowed depend on the

individual players, or can be broadcast to all players and
observers. <b>White press</b> refers to messages sent to other
players which indicates who it is from. <b>Grey press</b> is sent
out anonymously; the sender may sign his own, or someone else's,
name to it, but the Judge will not verify the source of the
message. In addition, the game settings can allow press sent to
individual people to be faked to appear as a broadcast message to
all people or to an alternate set of people. Finally, <b>Postal
Press</b> is delayed until after the results of the current phase
have been processed (while all other press is sent
immediately).</p>
<p class="level1text">The results of the <a class="plaintext"

<p class="level1text">The press setting values listed above can

allowable press. See <a href="#gameaccesssettings">section
8.4</a>. For example:</p>
<p class="example">SET GREY, PARTIAL FAKES BROADCAST</p>
<p class="level1text">would mean that all press (except to or
from the Master) would appear to be a grey broadcast message,
even if it is actually sent to only one player. (The press
settings that appear in the <a class="plaintext" href=
"#LIST">LIST</a> results will not be in exactly the same format
as shown above; for example, the "Observers None" setting would
appear as "No Observers".)</p>
<p class="level1text">Note: If fake press is allowed in a game,
press to the Master will <i>not</i> be faked, and you will get
scolded if you try.</p>
<p class="level1text">By default, games are "White, Partial
Allowed, No Fake, No PostalPress".</p>
<p class="level1text"><u>Options</u></p>
<p class="level1text">The <span class=
"plaintext">BROADCAST</span> command without options is
equivalent to "<span class="plaintext">PRESS TO ALL</span>"; that
is, the message will be sent to all players. However, using the
<span class="plaintext">PRESS</span> command without any options
will result in no message being sent. This is to prevent
accidental broadcasts, which can result in your secret attack
plans being sent to the entire game. Finally, if <span class=
"plaintext">BROADCAST</span> <i>is</i> followed by options, it is
treated exactly the same as a <span class=
"plaintext">PRESS</span> command (so if, for some odd reason, you
wrote "<span class="plaintext">BROADCAST TO G</span>", the
message would go only to Germany and not to the entire game).</p>
<p class="level1text">(1) color-options</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">WHITE | UNANONYMOUS
| UNANONYMOUSLY</span></p>
<p class="level2text">The message is sent out with your power and

grey press are both allowed and grey is the default.</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">GREY | ANONYMOUS |
ANONYMOUSLY</span></p>
<p class="level2text">The message is sent out with no indication
as to the originator. This is only necessary if white and grey
press are both allowed and white is the default.</p>
<p class="level1text">(2) delivery-options</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">TO list<br>
+list</span></p>
<p class="level2text">The message will be sent only to the list
of powers specified. The list consists of the single character
identifier for the powers combined as a single word. Thus "<span
class="plaintext">PRESS TO FRG</span>" would send the message to
France, Russia and Germany in a Standard game. In most variants
the first letter of the power is usually the character (but not
always; for instance, India in the Youngstown variant is N rather
than I since the latter is used to represent Italy). The special
characters O and M are interpreted Observer and Master
respectively in all variants.</p>
<p class="level2text"><b>Warning:</b> only use initials in the
list; you may be dismayed if you type "<span class=
"plaintext">PRESS TO Turkey</span>", because the Judge will try
to interpret "Turkey" as a list of initials. In a Standard game,
this will result in an error message, because U, K, and Y are not
valid power initials; in some variants, however, you might end up
sending a message to six players!</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">TO ALL BUT list<br>
-list</span></p>
<p class="level2text">The message is sent to all powers
<i>except</i> those specified in the list. Note that since all
press that can be read by Observers is archived in the game's
history file, a message sent "<span class="plaintext">PRESS TO
ALL BUT R</span>" (for example) will be available to Russia by
means of the History command. Use "<span class="plaintext">PRESS
TO ALL BUT RO</span>" to be sure that the message isn't archived.
Also, remember that a Master is able (if he wants) to read all
press regardless of how it is addressed.</p>
<p class="level1text">(3) Fake options</p>
<p class="level1text">The Judge's "fake press" options are not
often used, and as a result are not widely understood. "Fake"
press is press with a forged "To" line; you cannot use these
options to make it look like press came <i>from</i> someone else.
To hide the origin of press, you have to use the "<span class=
"plaintext">GREY</span>" color-option.</p>
<p class="level1text">The main use of "fake" press is to try to
fool certain players into thinking that other players did or did
not see your message when that is not the case. For example, you
could send a partial press only to one player but make it look
like a broadcast; or you could send a partial press to France and
Germany addressed only to France (so that France doesn't know
Germany also saw it). Some combinations of these options will
work but not make much sense; for instance, if you send a message
to Italy and it says "Press to Turkey" at the top, he will
obviously know it is faked.</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">[NO] FAKE
[BROADCAST]</span></p>
<p class="level2text">The message is faked (or not) as a
broadcast message to all players. The "<span class="plaintext">NO
FAKE</span>" option is needed only in a game that has the
"Partial Fake Broadcast by Default" setting.</p>
<p class="level1text"><span class="plaintext">FAKE [PARTIAL]

<p class="level2text">The message is faked as going to the set of
people specified even though it may be a broadcast message or be
a message sent to an alternate set of people. The delivery-option
may be any of the forms listed in the previous section.</p>
<p class="level2text">For fake press, you must first specify the
real recipients of the press (if not specified, a broadcast is
assumed), then put the word "<span class="plaintext">FAKE</span>"
followed by the addressees to be named in the message header
(again, if not specified, it is assumed that a fake broadcast is
intended). For example, "<span class="plaintext">PRESS FAKE TO
FRG</span>" will be interpreted as a broadcast message to
everyone that is faked as going to France, Russia and Germany
rather than a message going to France, Russia and Germany that is
faked as a broadcast. If the latter was intended the keyword
"<span class="plaintext">FAKE</span>" can be placed at the end as
in "<span class="plaintext">PRESS TO FRG FAKE</span>" or the
keyword "<span class="plaintext">BROADCAST</span>" must be
specified as in "<span class="plaintext">PRESS FAKE BROADCAST TO
FRG</span>". As an example in a Grey press game allowing fake
broadcasts, Italy might start off the game by posting the
following press message:</p>
<p class="example">PRESS TO ALL BUT G FAKE BROADCAST<br>
This is Germany and I think you all are wimps. I bet I can win
even if you all gang up against me.<br>
<br>
-Kaiser Bill<br>
ENDPRESS</p>
<p class="level2text">Everyone but Germany would get a press
message with a header of "Broadcast message in 'gamename':".
[Remember, however, that if Germany thinks to issue a <a class=
"plaintext" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a> command, he can see this
in the history archive. If this is undesirable, the command here
should read "<span class="plaintext">PRESS TO ALL BUT GO FAKE
BROADCAST</span>".] Then in the same (or a separate) message to
the adjudicator (since there can be more than one press message
per mail message) Italy could issue:</p>
<p class="example">PRESS TO R<br>
This is Austria, boy that Germany sure is obnoxious. Let's go all
out against him!<br>
<br>
-Ferdinand<br>
SIGNOFF</p>
<p class="level2text">Russia would get the message with a header
of "Message to Russia in 'gamename':". Of course, none of this
would work if the game was White press since Italy's name would
be in the header. If it was White/Grey, Italy would have to throw
in the "<span class="plaintext">GREY</span>" keyword to get the
effect, but even then (or if the game was Grey/White) it wouldn't
quite be the same since if Germany really meant to be so
obnoxious why wouldn't he just send the messages out as white
press?</p>
<p class="level1text">Press to the Master only is always allowed,
no matter what the press settings are, so that requests for
deadline extensions, or any other message needing the Master's
attention, can be sent without having to resort to direct email
outside of the game. Likewise, a Master can always issue press
commands, to communicate with the players.</p>
<p class="level1text">There are some commands that cause the
Judge to send messages to all the players (<i>e.g.</i>, changing
your return address in a non-gunboat game). If one of these
commands has been processed and a partial, faked partial or grey
press message is attempted, the Judge will send out the notice(s)
as separate messages, to all players, and the partial, faked, or
grey press will be sent as designated.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="ENDBROADCAST">ENDBROADCAST</a><br>
<a name="ENDPRESS">ENDPRESS</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Terminate a Press or Broadcast message.
Note that either form of this command will terminate either kind
of message. This command <i>must</i> appear on a line by itself,
or else it will be treated as part of the text of the message.
Unlike most commands, these words <i>cannot</i> contain a space
after the letters "<span class="plaintext">END</span>". Likewise,
if "<span class="plaintext">SIGN</span> <span class=
"plaintext">OFF</span>" is being used to terminate a press

<h2><a name="creatingandmastering">8. Creating and Mastering
Standard Games</a></h2>
<p>The commands in this section are used to "moderate" games;
that is, control various game settings affecting deadlines,
press, etc. Usually, these commands are issued by a Master, who
is a non-participant in the game. However, the Judge also is
configured to run "unmoderated" games, in which any of the
players can change some of the game settings. Many Judges do not
allow unmoderated games, so check with the Judgekeeper before
attempting to start this type of game. The term "moderator" means
either a Master in a moderated game, or any player in an
unmoderated game.</p>
<h3><a name="changingmoderationstatus">8.1 Changing Moderation
Status</a></h3>
<p class="command"><a name="BECOMEMASTER">BECOME MASTER</a></p>
<p class="level1text">When a game is created, the user who
created it is (under the default settings) signed on as a player.
To make the game moderated and become a Master, the user should
include this command immediately after the <a class="plaintext"
href="#CREATE">CREATE</a> command. The Judgekeeper can modify the
default settings so that the person who creates a game
automatically becomes a Master, in which case this command is
unnecessary; however, it does no harm to use it anyway.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETMODERATE">SET MODERATE[D]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Changes a game from unmoderated to
moderated. This is set by default by the "<a class="plaintext"
href="#BECOMEMASTER">BECOME MASTER</a>" command.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETUNMODERATE">SET
UNMODERATE[D]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Can only be issued by a Master. Changes the
game from moderated to unmoderated. As noted above, many
Judgekeepers do not permit unmoderated games.</p>
<h3><a name="masteronlycommands">8.2 Master-only
Commands</a></h3>
<p>The commands in this section can only be issued by a Master,
and therefore cannot be used at all in unmoderated games.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="BECOME">BECOME power</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Allows the moderator for a game to assume
the identity of a particular power. The <span class=
"plaintext">power</span> specification may be spelled out or
abbreviated. Any commands following this will be interpreted as
if they had been submitted by the specified power; this allows a
Master, for example, to change a player's password or to submit
orders for a power. As a result, no Master-only commands
(including another <span class="plaintext">BECOME</span>) can
follow a <span class="plaintext">BECOME</span> command.</p>
<p class="level1text">The player for "power" will receive a
message from the Judge advising him that the Master used the
<span class="plaintext">BECOME</span> command and confirming all
commands entered by the Master. <b>Warning</b>: this message will
include Master commands that preceded the <span class=
"plaintext">BECOME</span> command. Masters therefore should not
use any commands in the same message as a <span class=
"plaintext">BECOME</span> that they wouldn't want the player to
see.</p>
<p class="level1text">The <span class="plaintext">BECOME</span>
command is useful in a number of situations. One use is to submit
commands for a particular power if, for example, the player for
that power gets disconnected from the network and calls the
Master on the phone to give his orders.</p>
<p class="level1text">(Note, however, that a Master can submit
orders for any unit in the game without using the <span class=
"plaintext">BECOME</span> command. Orders for multiple units can
be specified on the same line, separated by commas or semicolons;
but you shouldn't mix orders for units belonging to multiple
powers on the same line. This technique is used in some variants
to allow the Master to manipulate the players' orders in some way
before entering them into the Judge. In other situations, the
<span class="plaintext">BECOME</span> command is preferred,
because otherwise the true owner of the power will not receive
the confirmation reply from the Judge. Also, the "orders have
been received" flag will <i>not</i> be set for a particular power
if their orders were submitted by the Master without the <span
class="plaintext">BECOME</span> command. It this case, it may be
necessary to use the <a class="plaintext" href=
"#PROCESS">PROCESS</a> command to get the phase processed.)</p>
<p class="level1text">You can also use the <span class=
"plaintext">BECOME</span> command to <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETABSENCE">SET ABSENCE</a> for a player, either because the
player isn't clear on how to do it themselves, or because their
requested absence exceeds the current <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETMAXABSENCE">MAX ABSENCE</a> setting. The <span class=
"plaintext">MAX</span> <span class="plaintext">ABSENCE</span>
setting does not apply to absences entered by the Master using
the <span class="plaintext">BECOME</span> command. However,
Masters should avoid approving unusually long delays without the
consent of the players (anything over two weeks is generally
considered "unusually long," although this depends on the
expectations of players in a particular game).</p>
<p class="level1text">The <span class="plaintext">BECOME</span>
command does not reveal the power's password to the Master
(except on some older versions of the Judge software). However,
the Master can use the <a class="plaintext" href=
"#SETPASSWORD">SET PASSWORD</a> command after <span class=
"plaintext">BECOME</span> to set a new password for a player who
has lost or forgotten theirs. Example:</p>
<p class="example">signon mexample password<br>
press to X<br>
Your new password will be "iforgot" (without the quotation
marks.)<br>
-- Master<br>
endpress<br>
become X<br>
set password iforgot<br>
signoff</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{0.8.9}</span><a
name="EJECT">EJECT power|email</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Resign a particular power. This is the only
command a Master may use to resign himself. If an email address
is specified, the command will work to resign observers too. The
"<span class="plaintext">EJECT</span> power" form will not work
if more than one person is signed on to the specified power
(which can occur if there is more than one Master or more than
one Observer in a game).</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{1.4.0}</span><a
name="FORCEBEGIN">FORCE BEGIN</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Forces a game to begin, even if not enough
players are signed on. The missing players will be filled in by
'dummy players' that are already abandoned (to allow real people
to sign on).</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{0.8.9}</span><a
name="PREDICT">PREDICT</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Will send to the Master a prediction of the
current turn, using partial orders already entered.</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{0.8.9}</span><a
name="PROMOTE">PROMOTE email</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Promote the Observer with the specified
email address to a Master. A game may have more than one Master
at any time. This will not work unless "<span class=
"plaintext">email</span>" is already recognized as the email
address of an Observer in the game.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="PROCESS">PROCESS [season year
phase]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Direct the Judge to process orders
immediately with whatever it has in its list. Partial or
nonexistent orders do not cause powers to be considered in civil
disorder. This can be useful after a <a class="plaintext" href=
"#ROLLBACK">ROLLBACK</a> command or if you want to not wait for a
player for some particular reason. If the optional (but highly
recommended) phase is specified, the <span class=
"plaintext">PROCESS</span> command will be ignored unless that is
indeed the current phase. Specifying the phase allows you to
avoid potential disaster if the Judge processed the desired phase
shortly ahead of getting your request. Without it, your command
would process the next phase, which could potentially expose
orders that players had pending. A typical "<span class=
"plaintext">season year phase</span>" specification might be
"<span class="plaintext">fall 1905 retreat</span>".</p>
<p class="command"><a name="ROLLBACK">ROLLBACK
[turn_number]</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Roll the game back to the specified turn
number. The turn number is displayed in all the reports and
lists, starting at 001 for spring 1901 moves (in a Standard game)
and incrementing for each actual phase that's played. Retreats
and adjustments that are not played do not increment the turn
number. If <span class="plaintext">turn_number</span> is omitted,
the game will be rolled back to the immediately preceding turn.
Specifically, this command will roll back the game to its state
immediately <i>before</i> <span class=
"plaintext">turn_number</span> was processed, so if you want to
roll the game back to the very start you could use "<span class=
"plaintext">ROLLBACK 001</span>". By contrast, "<span class=
"plaintext">ROLLBACK 002</span>" would return a Standard game to
the state that existed after Spring 1901 Moves but before Fall
1901 Moves.</p>
<p class="level1text">History is kept for at least a month, but
it may not be possible to go back too far - this command is
intended to go back one phase for the case where one person's
orders get messed up and need to be resubmitted. Orders for
intermediate turns that were skipped over should remain intact,
but those previous orders may wind up being meaningless based on
changes in the results of the reprocessed turn. Any pending
orders that existed will also be reprocessed so if they were
revised by hand the first time the replayed phase was processed
the revisions may get lost.</p>
<p class="level1text">Most Masters make it a policy never to
rollback a turn except to correct an adjudication error (which is
rare). If you do rollback a turn, you should immediately enter
the necessary corrections to orders and <a class="plaintext"
href="#PROCESS">PROCESS</a> the turn again.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETALLPRESS">SET ALL PRESS</a></p>
<p class="level1text">This command will cause all partial press
between the players to be copied (silently) to each Master as
well. This is useful in games involving novice players to help in
identifying and correcting common mistakes. It is also useful as
a precaution against cheating. Note, however, that in non-gunboat
games players may communicate directly rather than going through
the Judge, so you may miss traffic. If you use this option you
must pay careful attention so that you don't leak any information
to the other players.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETNORMALPRESS">SET NORMAL
PRESS</a></p>
<p class="level1text">This command clears the "All Press"
flag.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETQUIET">SET [NO] QUIET</a></p>
<p class="level1text">If enabled, no announcements about player
abandonment, power takeovers and such will be broadcast to the
other players or observers. Its purpose is to prevent information
from being disclosed in gunboat games, particularly tournaments
where multiple games may lose the same player.</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{0.8.9}</span><a
name="SETWATCHALLPRESS">SET [NO] WATCH ALL PRESS</a></p>
<p class="level1text">If enabled, allows Observers to use the <a
class="plaintext" href="#SETALLPRESS">SET ALL PRESS</a> command
to see partial press between players. Use with caution, for
obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="command"><span class="versioncode">{1.1.0}</span><a
name="UNSTART">UNSTART</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Return the game to the position immediately
prior to the start of the game. Powers will be unassigned and the
game will be flagged <a href="#SETMANUALSTART">Manual Start</a>.
Games can only be unstarted if no turns have yet processed. This
can be useful if a player is ejected or resigns; the game can be
unstarted, so a replacement can enter a preference list rather
than have to take whichever power is left.</p>
<h3><a name="standardgamemoderation">8.3 Standard Game Moderation
Commands</a></h3>
<p>Most of the <span class="plaintext">SET</span> commands in
this section (and in all following sections relating to game
moderation) will generate a message that will be sent to all
people involved in the game indicating that you've been mucking
around with the game parameters. Everyone active in the game
should agree before standard game settings are adjusted. A Master
has discretion to extend deadlines for particular turns upon
request; a Master ordinarily should not, however, shorten the
deadline without player consent.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="RESUME">RESUME</a></p>
<p class="level1text">Restart a completed or terminated game. Any

the default setting would set the grace period for Monday if the

the grace period to expire on Saturday in this situation.</p>

<h2><a name="configuringvariantgames">9. Configuring Variant
Games</a></h2>
<p>The Judge is capable of adjudicating a wide variety of
variants of the standard Diplomacy game. Some of these are "rules
variants" using the standard map with modified rules
(<i>e.g.</i>, different types of units, different number of
powers, different starting positions, etc.). Other variants
include a different map as well as non-standard rules.</p>
<p>For a list of all variants currently supported by a particular
Judge, send the command "<span class="plaintext"><a href=
"#SIGNON">SIGN ON</a> ? password XXX</span>" (where "<span class=
"plaintext">XXX</span>" can be anything that is <i>not</i> a
valid variant name). Most variants have an "info" file that
describes the variant, which can be obtained by sending the
command "<span class="plaintext"><a href="#GET">GET</a>
INFO.variant</span>", where <span class=
"plaintext">variant</span> is a valid variant name.</p>
<p>The Judge also recognizes a few "variant options" that can be
combined with any variant (including the Standard "variant").
These also have their own <span class=
"plaintext">INFO.option</span> files.</p>
<p>The variant can be specified either by including it in the <a
class="plaintext" href="#CREATE">CREATE</a> command, see <a href=
"#creatingobservingand">section 4</a>, or by using the following
commands before the game starts.</p>
<p class="command"><a name="SETVARIANT">SET VARIANT
variant|option</a></p>
<p class="level1text">To change the variant of a game, or add an
optional rule. This can only be done before the powers are

variant type have signed on. <span class="plaintext">SET</span>
<span class="plaintext">VARIANT</span> can only be used to set
one option per command (unlike <a class="plaintext" href=
