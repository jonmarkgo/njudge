<h2><a name="1.2">1.2 Last version</a></h2>

<p> This is an installation guide which aims to be more complete and
newbie-friendly than the INSTALL file.

<p> This file deals with installing a clean standard version of njudge v 1.3.2.
There are good chances it will work for following versions (especially as
the installation process has stabilized recently).

<p>The version number of this file follows judge versions.
<br>The reference version is now the HTML guide. The text should be
automatically generated against the HTML.
<br>Anyway, the last version of this file should always be in the last CVS
snapshot of the judge at <a href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a>.

<h2><a name="1.3">1.3 Why?</a></h2>

<p> Once upon a time, a young man decided to install a Diplomacy judge on
his Linux box.  He wanted to learn C, improve his Unix administration
knowledge, code some new variants, and say to his friends on the mailing
list 'Look! I have a judge!'.

<p> This is a story of stupid mistakes, problematic compilations, crashing
code, lost mails, strange behaviour, and friendly help from the Friends
Who Know (thanks Philippe and the other JKs!).

<p> As he wanted the others not to suffer as much as he did, as he wanted to
contribute to the Diplomacy community, as he couldn't do anything else
than writing documentation, he wrote the present installation guide.

<p> It is a compilation of what I have read in the judge files and code, on the
judge-maint mailing-list, of what I have learned myself by installing the judge
(versions: 0.8.6-FROG, 0.8.7, 0.8.9, 1.0.0,
1.1.1, 1.3.0-pre, 1.3.2). Comments, advice, corrections [including spelling and
grammar, I'm not a native English speaker] are <a href="christophe@courtois.cc">welcomed</a> (in
French, English or German)!

<p> This guide is focused on the installation on Linux, but should be okay for most Unices.
If you know of some platform-specific installation problems, please ask me to add it there.

<h2><a name="1.4">1.4 Configuration</a></h2>

<p> The present HOWTO comes from my experience in installing the judge ALEX on my Linux box.

<table><tr>
<td>Computer: <td>Pentium 75</tr>
<td>OS:       <td>Linux Debian 3.0 (woody)</tr>
<td>Judge:    <td>njudge 1.3.2 compiled from source</tr>

<h1><a name="2">2 Before installing</a></h1>

<h2><a name="2.1">2.1 Material, learning and paperwork</a></h2>

<p> Before installing the judge there are a few things you need to do :

<p>- Find a box (a 486 is enough, such a powerful machine didn't even
exist when the first version of the judge was written; the real load will come from your OS and
the e-mail amount).

<p>- Install a Unix system on it. For example, Linux (any distribution
is good enough), as the last versions of the judge are often running and maintained on Linux.
<br> In the past, many judges were running on SunOS, HP-UX or Irix,
but the judge wasn't recently compiled on it.  Some judges run
currently on Solaris, Linux-x86 (different distributions), and Linux-alpha (Debian).
<br> The judge does compile on FreeBSD-x86, Darwin-ppc (and then
on MacOS&nbsp;X); I don't know if some judges use these systems.
<br> There was some discussion on a Win32 port. Maybe is it possible to
use <a href="http://www.cygwin.org/">Cygwin</a> to run a judge on Windows.

<p>- Connect it permanently on the Internet through modem, xDSL, T1,
cable... (although a disconnected judge should perfectly work only
for local users, or could work with an intermittent connection if the deadlines are long enough).

<p>- Learn the basis of system administration (users, access rights, shell, basic commands, compiling).

<p>- Begin to learn C.  It is not necessary to install the judge (I'm
a living proof of that), but it is to search efficiently for bugs or modify the source. You
don't really need it for creating simple variants.

<p>- Decide what you will do with that judge: experimentation? private for
friends? candidate for the biggest running judge? just for fun?

<p>- Decide what name you'll give to your judge.  Theoretically, it should
begin by the ISO code of the country it is in. <a href="http://frog.born2play.org/">FROG</a>
is in France, <a href="http://www.courtois.cc/alex/">ALEX</a> should have been in Albania,
USEF is in the United States and so on.

<p>- Not necessary for a private judge: Send a mail to
<a href="mailto:nfitz@sentex.net">Nicholas Fitzpatrick (nfitz@sentex.net)</a>
to tell him that you want to open a judge, and ask him to bless its name and add it in
<a href="http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/judge.codes">its list of judges</a>

<p>- If you want your judge to go more or less public and Nicholas is okay
with the name, you can add it on the
<a href="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html">DipPouch Judge Registration Form
(http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html)</a> to make it easier
for people to register on your judge.

<p>- Subscribe to the judge-keepers mailing-list (send a mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@diplom.org">majordomo@diplom.org</a>
with 'help' in the body).  It is actually a judge
maintenance mailing list.  The JKs just happen to all be there.
<br> There are archives of this list available on Alain Tesio's website:
<a href="http://www.floc.net/exarch/judgemaint.html">http://www.floc.net/exarch/judgemaint.html</a>


<h2><a name="2.2">2.2 Getting the source code or the package</a></h2>

<p> Download the source of the judge from the net :
<a href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a>
is the official download site from Millis Miller
and should indicate which is the last official judge version available,
and give you a link to download it.

<p> A CVS snapshot is available too.  It is a tarball generated every day
from the CVS (development) tree.  It is the most current (and unstable!)
judge, only for people who know what they are doing.  A direct CVS access
is possible only with an account on the development computer.

<p> Other sources where you can search in case of a problem on njudge.org:
   * ftp.diplom.org/pub/diplomacy/Sources/

<p>- The official judge is distributed as a source code tarball called
njudge-1.X.Y.tar.gz, where X and Y change with time.  Current version is 1.3.2. Please ignore
njudge-0.8.X and dipsrc-9XXX files if you find some, they are out of date.

<p>- If you're lucky enough to work with a Debian Linux, you have a
package available at Braincells:
<a href="http://src.braincells.com/debian/woody/njudge/">http://src.braincells.com/debian/woody/njudge/</a>
<br> See below (section 4.) how to install it.  You can skip the
Unix configuration and the compilation below.  Your judge will use the
'<tt>judge</tt>' user name, and will be installed directly in
<tt>/home/judge</tt> (no <tt>dip/</tt> binary directory).


<h2><a name="2.3">2.3 Judge user: unix level configuration</a></h2>

<p>- Create an account for the judge on your system.  The name of the account
may be anything as long as it does NOT contain a '-'.  It is often <tt>judge@...</tt>
The judge must have its own e-mail address.  You can create aliases
to redirect <tt>judge@...</tt> on any other account (the setup is usually in <tt>/etc/aliases</tt>).
<br> For ALEX, the user is '<tt>alex</tt>' and '<tt>judge</tt>' is redirected on it.

<p><b>NB:</b> To write to the judge from the Internet, you need a valid domain
(like foo.com, toto.fr, bar.edu), which can be obtained only with a
permanent IP.  If the box has no permanent IP address (like most personal
computers on xDSL or cable), it is possible to use dynamic DNS (for
example <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">Dyndns.org</a>) to have an address anybody on the net
can write to.  Or you can hack something (with fetchmail for example) to retrieve mail
every 10 minutes from a 'real' account (good thing for a disconnected judge).

<p>- Log out and log yourself as the judge user.

<p>- Verify that the commands <tt>rm, cat, date, echo, at, atrm</tt> are ready to
use without any directory indication.  They must be in directories of
<tt>$PATH</tt>. If you use bash as often on Linux, you may need to modify <tt>.bashrc</tt>
and/or <tt>.profile</tt>.

<p>- As the judge script use the csh shell (and not the more popular bash),
put the judge binary directories in the <tt>.cshrc</tt> file.  For example:

<br><tt>setenv PATH /usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/home/alex/dip:/home/alex:/bin:~:.</tt>

<p>- All the examples here deal with <tt>njudge-1.3.2.tar.gz</tt>.

<p>- Extract the archive:

<p><tt>tar xzvf njudge-1.3.2.tar.gz</tt>

<p> The file is extracted into a new directory called <tt>njudge-1.3.2</tt>.
As I have many versions of the judge on my hard disk, I have created
a 'source' symbolic link which points to the real current source directory.

<p><tt>    cd ~
<br>    ln -s njudge-1.3.2 source</tt>

<p>- Browse the files you have obtained.  You can read the README.* or docs/README.* files now,
even if you don't understand everything now.  (Some of them are clearly out-of-date;
they are usually in <tt>docs/archives/</tt>).

<p>- Create a new directory in the judge's home for the compiled judge. It
will contain binaries, judge configuration files, games, maps... The
directory is often called '<tt>dip</tt>'.

<p> For ALEX :

<p><tt>    mkdir /home/alex/dip</tt>

<p> This may be useless as the installation process should create the
directory; but it can't hurt.  Note that some people like to install
the binaries directly under /home/judge.


<h2><a name="2.4">2.4 Configure before compilation</a></h2>

<p>- The judge uses the GNU Autotools (automake, autoconf) as its build system
(thanks for that, <a href="http://www.braincells.com/jaldhar/">Jaldhar</a> ;-)
<tt>automake</tt> and <tt>autoconf</tt> are pretty much standard
on Unix-like systems these days but if your vendor or distribution does not
provide them, you can download them from
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/</a>.
You will need at least version 2.50 of <tt>autoconf</tt>.

<p>- Some modifications (including changing the judge version if you modify it)
involves modifications before launching <tt>./configure</tt>. Read <tt>docs/README.hackers</tt>
or wait until the present guide is updated.

<p>- A simple '<tt>./configure</tt>' at the command line is not really enough;
as you may have another user than '<tt>judge</tt>' and may want to use the '<tt>dip</tt>'
directory to store the binaries instead of the root of the user directory,
the command line is more something like:

<p><tt>./configure --with-dir=/home/alex/dip --with-user=alex --with-domain=christophecourtois.org</tt>

<p>where <tt>alex</tt> must be replaced by your judge user name, <tt>christophecourtois.org</tt>
by the domain of your judge where the address must appear to come from.

<p> If you're using <tt>csh</tt> on an old version of System V, you might need to
type '<tt>sh ./configure</tt>' instead to prevent <tt>csh</tt> from trying to execute
<tt>configure</tt> itself.

<p> There are many other command line flags you can give (type
'<tt>./configure --help</tt>' for a full list) but <tt>--with-dir</tt> and <tt>--with-user</tt>
are the main ones you're likely to use.

<p> This command will detect your system configuration, binaries paths...
to generate a <tt>Makefile</tt> suited to your system.

<p>- (This should not be necessary on new judges) Verify permissions
and change them if necessary to be able to write to the files.

<p><tt>  cd ~/source
<br>  chmod -R u+w *
</tt>

<h2><a name="2.5">2.5 The Makefile</a></h2>

<p>- The <tt>Makefile</tt> was created through <tt>./configure</tt>.  It must not be
modified anymore (as in the good old times).

<p>- The following targets exist in the <tt>Makefile</tt>, with their use:

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><tt>all</tt>:            <td>Rebuild all programs
<tr><td><tt>ascii_to_ded</tt>:   <td>Convert text file ded.txt to dip.ded
<tr><td><tt>ded_to_ascii</tt>:	<td>Convert dip.ded to text file
<tr><td><tt>dip</tt>:            <td>Rebuild dip program
<tr><td><tt>cmap</tt>:           <td>Rebuild cmap program
<tr><td><tt>summary</tt>:        <td>Rebuild summary program
<tr><td><tt>deddump</tt>:        <td>Rebuild deddump program
<tr><td><tt>delgame</tt>:        <td>Rebuild delgame program (to erase permanentely a game)

<tr><td><tt>rdip</tt>:           <td>Rebuild rdip program
<tr><td><tt>install</tt>:        <td>build and install a judge (Note: this will check if dip.master
                file exists and refuse to run if so, avoiding inadvertently
                deleting an existing njudge installation.)
<tr><td><tt>upgrade</tt>:        <td>Rebuild all the programs and install them in correct
                directory (used principally for updating a running

</table>

<h2><a name="2.6">2.6 smail.in script</a></h2>

<p>'<tt>smail</tt>' is the script which builds the messages and sends them. This script
is created during the compilation.  There is a <tt>smail.in</tt> script which
contains the default lines.  (Change only <tt>smail.in</tt>, as smail is destroyed when recompiling).

<p>- You should not change the <tt>FROM</tt> line: there go the user and the domain that
you indicated when launching <tt>./configure</tt>.

<p>- The judge uses <tt>dip.msg</tt> (if it exists) as a header for all messages.
You can create such a file with any content you like.

<p>- If you want to use a footer in judge messages too, you will have to create a file named
<tt>dip.footer</tt>, and add it in the parameters of cat on the 10<sup>th</sup> line of the script:

<p><tt> cat dip.msg $1 dip.footer</tt>

<p>(I'll try to put this in the official distribution someday).

<p>- <b>Warning</b> : <tt>dip.msg</tt> and <tt>dip.footer</tt> must be configured AFTER the installation,
they won't be copid when installing.
<br>Think to remove the useless blank lines in them.  Don't try to add too much and take the risk to
break some tools relying on the judge e-mail format.

<p>- The <tt>smail</tt> script may need other modifications.  For example, Greg Greenman
had some problem on USTX with the mails headers with
sendmail. This is his smail script which solves the problems:

<p><tt>
<br>     #!/bin/csh
<br>     # /bin/sh  (Note: /bin/sh fails to work if N files are open)
<br>     #
<br>     #  Invoked as smail file subject address
<br>     #
<br>     # parameters
<br>     # $1 - name of the file containing the message body
<br>     # $2 - subject
<br>     # $3 - e-mail address
<br>     date &gt;&gt;mail.log
<br>     echo "===== mail sent to $3/$2" >>mail.log
<br>     /usr/bin/head -10 $1 >>mail.log
<br>     cat > /tmp/dip.reply &lt;&lt; _EOF_
<br>     Subject: $2
<br>     From: USTX Diplomacy Judge &lt;judge@spencersoft.com&gt;
<br>     To: $3
<br>
<br>      _EOF_
<br>      cat dip.msg $1 dip.footer &gt;&gt; /tmp/dip.reply
<br>      /usr/sbin/sendmail -f judge@spencersoft.com &lt;/tmp/dip.reply $3
<br>     rm -f /tmp/dip.reply
<br>     rm -f dip.xfail
</tt>

<h2><a name="2.7">2.7 sendmail problems</a></h2>

<br> Some people had problems with some <tt>sendmail</tt> configuration (especially
with <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Linux</a>).  If you use <tt>smrsh</tt>,
place a symbolic link to <tt>rdip</tt> in the <tt>/etc/smrsh/</tt> dir.  Also make sure
only the owner has write permission to the <tt>.forward</tt> file.
<br> (Briefly: <tt>smrsh</tt> allows only programs from a unique directory to call
sendmail, allowing the system administrator to choose the set of acceptable commands).

<h2><a name="2.8">atrun script</a></h2>

<p> '<tt>atrun</tt>' is responsible for putting the '<tt>diprun</tt>' script in the '<tt>at</tt>'
queue. '<tt>at</tt>' is a system command to schedule launch of programs. '<tt>diprun</tt>'
will itself launch the '<tt>rdip</tt>' program.

<p> <b>NB:</b> If you schedule any jobs as the judge user using <tt>at</tt>, they will
be deleted the next time that the Judge receives an e-mail.

<p> There are three predefined versions in <tt>atrun</tt> for Solaris, Linux
(see below) and MIPS. Activate the version which suits your system.

<p> A problem is that some Linux versions of atq don't tell you
the command each entry will run at the given time, so there is no
way to delete the rdip entry but not the dipclean entry. So the way
to get around this in some Linux system, is to put one on one queue,
and one on another queue, and then search by queue.

<p>This is the script if you need it:
<p><tt>
<br>     #! /bin/csh
<br>     #
<br>     #  Invoked as: atrun norm time month day
<br>     #          or: atrun dorm time month day
<br>     #
<br> if ("$1" == "dorm") then
<br>       atrm `atq | awk '{print $1}'` &gt;& /dev/null
<br>     endif
<br>
<br>     at -q b -f diprun $2 $3 $4
<br>     rm -f dip.xfail
</tt>

<h2><a name="2.9">2.9 defaults.inc.in: changing default parameters</a></h2>

<p>- This file contains judge default parameters that can't be change without recompiling the judge.
See README.hackers if you want to change some.

<h2><a name="2.10">2.10 Other source modifications</a></h2>

<p> If you have a very busy judge, the <tt>MAXUSER</tt> parameter in <tt>dip.h</tt>,
set by default to 8000, may be increased.

<h2><a name="2.11">2.11 Patches</a></h2>

<p> No known last-minute patch to add to the official version. (Stable versions are not
so much fun anymore ;-)


<h1><a name="3">3. Compilation and installation</a></h1>

<h2><a name="3.1">3.1 Compilation</a></h2>

<p> - It should be easy and painless. Enter on the command line:

<p><tt>        make all</tt>

<p>and the judge will be compiled.

<h2><a name="3.2">3.2 Installation</a></h2>

<p>- Type:

<p><tt>        make install       #for a new judge only!</tt>

<p> This copies everything that the judge needs into the
destination directory you gave to <tt>./configure</tt>.  On a running judge,
use '<tt>make upgrade</tt>' (see below).  You don't need to be root, and
nothing will be installed outside of the judge directory.

<p>- Total compilation time: it depends of your CPU, of course.  On my old
P75 with 24&nbsp;Mb memory, it takes less than 30 minutes.

<p>- The installation ends with a message telling you to modify <tt>dip.conf</tt>
and other files (what you have already done), and to activate the
judge by renaming <tt>xxxx-forward</tt> as <tt>.forward</tt> (see below).

<p>- Compiled programs will not be stripped of debug and other extra
information.  If you want to make compiled programs a little smaller,
you can type '<tt>make install-strip</tt>' or '<tt>make upgrade-strip</tt>' instead.  This
may give a few harmless errors (when it tries to strip scripts) but you can ignore them.

<h2><a name="3.2">3.3 Cleaning</a></h2>

<p>- You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source code directory by typing `<tt>make clean</tt>'.  To also remove the
files that `<tt>configure</tt>' created (so you can compile the package for
a different kind of computer), type `<tt>make distclean</tt>'.


<h1><a name="4">4 Installing the Debian package</a></h1>

<p> - To avoid compiling yourself, you can get the Debian package from Jaldhar Vyas.
<br>Download the version suitable for your architecture from
<a href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a>
if it is available there, or from
<a href="http://src.braincells.com/debian/woody/njudge/">http://src.braincells.com/debian/woody/njudge/</a>,
and (as root) use <tt>dpkg</tt> to install it, or add the lines given on the site to your
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>, run <tt>apt-get update</tt> and <tt>apt-get install</tt> it.
<br> It is still to be considered experimental.

<p>- It will create a user called '<tt>judge</tt>', with its directory '<tt>/home/judge</tt>'
containing all binaries and data files (yes, it is against the Debian policy).
<br> There is no <tt>dip/</tt> directory.

<p> Before running the judge, you still must configure <tt>dip.conf</tt> as described below.


<h1><a name="5">5 Configuring your new judge</a></h1>

<h2><a name="5.1">5.1 Dip.conf</a></h2>

<p>- Go to the binary directory ( <tt>/home/alex/dip</tt> in my example,
<tt>/home/judge</tt> or <tt>/home/judge/dip/</tt> maybe for you).

<p>- In the binary of the executables, the configuration file <tt>dip.conf</tt>
contains all non-hard-coded parameters before compilation.  You must check the following variables:

<p>   * <tt>GAMES_MASTER</tt> (put YOUR email address or an alias on it, NOT the judge address!!).
<br>   * <tt>OURSELVES</tt> (the Unix user name of the judge; it is used to
avoid mail loops); you can keep the name 'judge' if this is its name.
<br>   * <tt>JUDGE_CODE</tt> (codename of your judge: ALEX,FROG,USEF...),
<br>   * <tt>SPECIAL_PW</tt> (the password for the judge-keeper, keep it for yourself!).

<p>- Optionally, you can decide in which directory must go all running games
by setting the <tt>GAME_DIR</tt> variable.  You MUST create the directory before running the judge.
<br> Example:
<p><tt>GAME_DIR=games/</tt>

<p> Don't forget the last '/'!

<p>By default (and <strike>conservatism</strike> compatibility with old judges), <tt>GAME_DIR=D</tt>. If you leave this variable commented out, the
games subdirectories will accumulate in the <tt>dip/</tt> directory with a name
beginning by D (example : Dtest).  So if you move existing game
subdirectories from <tt>~/dip/</tt> to <tt>~/dip/my_games/</tt>, you must set
<tt>GAME_DIR=./my_games/D</tt> (or remove the leading D from all game subdirectories).
You must set the full path if going outside the judge directory
(ex: <tt>/home/alex/games/</tt> ).

<p> Don't use it to share the games across more than one judge, unless you share
other files like <tt>dip.whois</tt> or <tt>dip.addr</tt> and avoid concurrent access (dangerous!).

<p>- Default values for other parameters are usually okay.  You may
need to comment out some of them before changing them.  Be careful with
<tt>HALL_KEEPER</tt>, <tt>GAMES_OPENER</tt> and other mail variables, that MUST be commented
out if you're not running a public stable judge with real games.  Don't change
variables like <tt>XFORWARD</tt>, <tt>KEEPOUT</tt>;.. if you don't know what you're really doing.

<h2><a name="5.2">5.2 Other dip.* files</a></h2>

<p>- Verify the existence of the following files. If they are not there,
create them using the '<tt>touch</tt>' command.  They contain the games data:
        <br> - <tt>dip.master</tt> (should already exist with a game named 'control';
you may log into the game and edit <tt>dip.master</tt> to promote yourself as
master, in order to receive some administrative mail from the judge)
        <br> - <tt>dip.whois</tt>
        <br> - <tt>dip.addr</tt>

<p>- Create or fill in the following files:
        <br> - <tt>dip.msg</tt> : each message sent by the judge to players begins
with the content of this file. Put welcome messages there, address of
the judge keeper... May be empty.
        <br> - <tt>dip.footer</tt> : each message ends by the content of this file
(optional, see 'smail' script above). May be empty.
        <br> - <tt>ALLOW.map</tt> (if you want to allow use of the map command to
produce .ps maps of a game)
        <br> - <tt>ALLOW.map-star</tt> (if you want to allow use of the 'map *'
command to produce .ps maps of a game based on a LIST output).  <i>[Do
these options really work nowadays?]</i>

<h2><a name="5.3">5.3 dipclean</a></h2>

<p>- (This bug should be corrected in 1.3.2 judges) Open the '<tt>dipclean</tt>' script and change any path that doesn't match
your system (especially the first line).

<p>- It is now useless to run it for a first install.

<h2><a name="5.4">5.4 .forward</a></h2>

<p>(Already done if installing through the Debian package).

<p> In the home directory of the judge, a file '<tt>.forward</tt>' must be created.
It is usually enough to rename the '<tt>xxxx-forward</tt>' file (where xxxx is
your judge name) in the <tt>dip/</tt> directory.  It was generated while compiling.
It will redirect automagically all the incoming mails to the judge program.

<p> It must contain one line (there is no leading space and a comma at the beginning).  For example:

<p><tt>        ,"| /home/alex/dip/rdip -b -d /home/alex/dip "</tt>

<p>(for a judge in /home/alex, with binaries in <tt>/home/alex/dip</tt> ; change it
according to your needs, but the install process should have made it for you).

<p> Some judges (FROG for example) don't use this file and call <tt>procmail</tt>
to make some processing instead of or before launching the judge program
(mainly logging). Ask on the judge-keepers list (especially to Philippe&nbsp;Lalande)
for more information.

<h2><a name="5.5">5.5 dip.control date problems</a></h2>

<p> The <tt>dip.master</tt> file is generated from the <tt>Makefile</tt>, and according
to the configuration of your system, it can be faulty (although it may
be corrected on 1.3 judges).
<p> Check that:
 <br>- it does not contain AM or PM
 <br>- that months are Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec,
and nothing else (see source file <tt>jm.c</tt>).  If your computer is not
English-speaking, and does not put a capital at the beginning, it will bail out.

<p> This is for example a valid file:
<p><tt>
<br>control&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;001       S1801MX   1 1 1 0 2 18 7
<br>Process&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mon Jan 06 14:05:45 2003

contributors to the Diplomacy judge, <tt>TODO</tt>, which contains bugs, whishlist,
and modifications in progress, <tt>CHANGES</tt>, if you need to know the last modifications.

<p> The <tt>archives/</tt> subdirectory contains files which are out-of-date
but may be useful for old versions of the judge, for migrating, or for historical purpose.

<h1><a name="7">7. Testing the judge, first game</a></h1>

<h2><a name="7.1">7.1 Manual basic testing</a></h2>

<p> If you have configured everything, the judge should be able to
answer.  If any of the following tests fails, see 'Troubleshooting',
and check that everything above is OK.

<p>- From your normal account, with any mail agent you want, send him
a mail with only '<tt>version</tt>' in the body. It should answer very quickly
(if the machine is not overloaded and if there is no network problem)
with its version number (probably 1.3.2 if you are dealing with the
standard judge), the number of registered players and running games.

<p>- Ask him the help files : '<tt>get package</tt>', '<tt>get index</tt>' , '<tt>get info</tt>'

<p>- Register as a new player.  In case you had forgotten the syntax:
<p>
<tt>REGISTER
<br>Name: Marechal Joffre
<br>Country: France
<br>Site: Verdun
<br>Email: put_your_email@here
<br>Age: 142
<br>Phone:0123456789
<br>END
</tt>

<p>- Then, verify in dip.addr and dip.whois that you are registered.

<p>- Create a new game.  Take a script for a standard game (let's call it
'<tt>test<:tt>'), and send it. For example :

<p><tt>create ?test password standard
<br>set list
<br>set dedication -666
<br>set access anysite
<br>set level any
<br>set comment FIRST GAME !!!!!!
<br>set press white/grey
<br>set partial
<br>set observer no
<br>set all press
<br>set rated
<br>set noreveal
<br>set DIAS
<br>set NONMR
<br>set move delay 0.01
<br>set adjust delay 0
<br>set retreat delay 0
</tt>

<p> Don't set it 'private' or 'nolist'.  Don't become master now
(NB: Some judges (FROG) automatically promote you as the master of the
game, see parameter AUTO_MASTER above), or use another e-mail account.

<p>- Send another message to the judge : '<tt>list</tt>'.  Then '<tt>list full</tt>'.
Then '<tt>list test</tt>'.  The judge should answer you and give you the game parameters.

<p>- Now the funny part : send:

<p><tt> signon ?test password
<br>  set players 1
</tt>

<p> As you're the only player, and not the master, the game should begin
at this moment.  You can enter orders the way you want, you are all
players at the same time!  You will receive a lot of mail saying that the game is starting.

<p> You don't need to be the master. You can always act as a master
in the game by sending mail as the judge keeper:
<p><tt> signon @test SPECIAL_PW</tt>  (where <tt>SPECIAL_PW</tt> is the one defined <tt>in dip.conf</tt>)

<p>- Check press (grey, white...) by sending mail between powers.

<p>- Now let's test the deadline system: send a deadline in a few
minutes, check that the grace date is postponed, and wait for the
players to fall late or abandon.  You can always raise your dedication
back with '<tt>adjust &lt;user_id&gt; &lt;increase&gt;</tt>' later (anyway, JKs are not
supposed to play real games on their own judge :-)

<p>- Move everything, make convoys (now, you can freely make a Lvn-Syr
convoy :-).  Try phase orders.  Try proxy orders.

<p>- Check that dedication evolves when you give orders.

<p>- Verify that '<tt>process</tt>' and '<tt>rollback</tt>' do function.  If you want
the game to finish normally and quickly, change the parameters to NoDIAS, make a quick draw.

<p>- Check variants too! A h32 (Hundred) could be quicker to check the
full commands than a standard.  A 'chess' variant (not yet on a 1.3.2 judge) would be good too.

<h2><a name="7.2">7.2 Automatic judge tester</a></h2>

<p>Yes, it would be fine to have one.  As far as I know, nobody finished one.


<h1><a name="8">8. Troubleshooting</a></h1>

<p>These are some problems and solutions:

<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>Nothings happen when sending something to the judge and in <tt>dip.log</tt>,
the judge complains he didn't find rm, date, echo... and other commands
<td>This is a PATH problem.  Be careful : The script uses csh as a
shell, and not bash that often.  Check '.cshrc' in the home directory.
Check that mail and head are in the locations defined in
Makefile (to avoid a reinstallation, add symbolic links).

<tr><td>Judges makes a bailout<td>The judge can send to the judgekeeper a
message saying 'Bailout executed'.  It means that the judge died.  It has
crashed.  <tt>.forward</tt> was renamed to <tt>zforward</tt>.  To solve the problem without
losing some mails, you must follow the instructions in <tt>README.bailout</tt>.

<tr><td>The judge complains that <tt>dip.input</tt> exists<td>You didn't clean this
file after a previous crash.  See <tt>README.bailout</tt> if you don't want to
lose what it contains.

<tr><td>The judge crashes at the first time, in <tt>dipent.c</tt>
<td>Check that the <tt>dip.master</tt>
file was not generated with a bad format in <tt>dip.control</tt> (see <a href="#5.5"5.5</a>).

<tr><td>The judge crashes when you try a new variant<td>Look in <tt>install.log</tt>
what variants are installed.  Check that all files (source and compiled) are there.
</table>

<p>For other problems, read all the log files, the answer must be there.
<br><tt>dip.log</tt> contains what came to the judge and the actions it tried to do,
<br><tt>mail.log</tt> contains all mails sent.  At the very beginning, you have to
check the existence of all files (including <tt>dip.master</tt>, <tt>dip.whois</tt>...)
And don't forget to read <tt>README.bailout</tt>.


<h1><a name="9">9. Other customisations</a></h1>

<p>- You can change the text in <tt>dip.msg</tt> and <tt>dip.footer</tt> any way you want,
these are just files added at the beginning or the end of mails sent by the judge.

<p>The <tt>report.*</tt> files in <tt>data/</tt> are the beginning positions sent to
the judge when a game begins.  They're just text and you can change
whatever you want there and add silly comments.  (Be careful not to
break software like DipChief or web observers...)

<p>You can read <tt>README.hackers</tt> if you change the code.

<h1><a name="10">10. Backup</a></h1>

<p> As far as I know and have experimented, the easiest way to backup the
judge is to make a big archive of it and put it anywhere else where it
is safe.  Usually the judge doesn't use any file outside its home
directory.  For example :

<p><tt> tar czvf /backup-directory/judge-archive.tgz /home/alex/*</tt>

<p> You can copy it uncompressed on another drive (this example copies
only newer files):

<p><tt> cp -upR /home/alex/* /backup-directory/</tt>

<p> Anyway, the backup must be made as often as possible (put it in your <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>).

<p> Be careful: it will probably change in the next versions of the judge,
with data in <tt>/var/njudge</tt> for example.


<h1><a name="11">11. Upgrading and patching a judge</a></h1>

<h2><a name="11.1">11.1 Locking the judge</a></h2>

<p> Let's suppose that you want to modify the source code of the judge
with a patch found on judge-maint. (This example suppose that you have a
symlink '<tt>source</tt>' pointing to the real 1.3.2 tree).

<p> Lock the judge: enter '<tt>flock dip.log</tt>' in the executables (often '<tt>dip/</tt>') directory.

<h2><a name="11.2">11.2 Archiving</a></h2>

<p>- Copy the '<tt>dip/</tt>' directory and archive it.  For example:
<p><tt>        cp -R dip dip.backup</tt>

<p>- Create a new source directory to be sure

<p><tt>cp -R njudge-1.3.2 njudge-1.3.2-patch1</tt>

<p>- Make the '<tt>source</tt>' symlink to point to the new directory.
<p><tt>        rm source
<br>        ln -s /home/alex/njudge-1.3.2-patch1 source
</tt>

<h2><a name="11.3">11.3 Makefile variables</a></h2>

<p> This part is now useless, as the new autoconf/automake process generates
automatically the Makefile.
<p> Read <tt>docs/README.hackers</tt> until this part is updated.


<h2><a name="11.4">11.4 Patching or upgrading source code</a></h2>

<p>- Modify the .c code, or apply a patch (this way for example:
<tt>patch summary.c patch-bug160701 </tt>), or download the last CVS version
if you have an account on devel.diplom.org, or download a whole new
source code tarball in a *new* source directory.

<p>- You should really read <tt>docs/README.hackers</tt> from Jaldhar Vyas when
playing with judge source code modifications, as it sometimes involves
to re-run <tt>automake/autoconf</tt>.

<p>- If you use a new source directory (when upgrading), you won't compile without making a
'<tt>./configure</tt>' again.  You should use the same parameters and it will spit the same Makefile.  But
if you have changed them before, you must get the <tt>smail.in</tt> and <tt>defaults.inc.in</tt> from
your old judge source.
<br> Don't forget to read
the <tt>INSTALL</tt> and <tt>InstallationHOWTO.html</tt> files of this new version to be sure
that the important configuration files to move across both versions
are the same (judge maintainers try to do it).

<p>- <tt>dip.conf</tt> is the configuration file, stored in the binaries directory,
and will not be overwritten.  Please check that the new version doesn't contain new parameters.  Other
customisation files (<tt>dip.msg, dip.footer</tt>...) won't be overwritten.

<p>- Add any new file that the judge would need (variants...).  Be very careful of
including files of the form <tt>foo.[0-9x]</tt> in the <tt>data/</tt>
directory.  The tools that maintain the flist handle them in a different
way, which can produce some really weird results.
<br>See <tt>README.hackers</tt> too.

<p>- Lauch the configure.  In my example :

<p><tt>./configure --with-dir=/home/alex/dip --with-user=alex --with-domain=christophecourtois.org</tt>

<p>- If you just want to rebuild the map files (because e.g. you added a new
variant,) type '<tt>make remap</tt>'.


<h2><a name="11.5">11.5 Recompiling and installation</a></h2>

<p>- Recompile and reinstall:
<p><tt>        make clean
<br>        make all
<br>        make upgrade
</tt>

<p>(<b>NB:</b> if you make a mistake and type '<tt>make install</tt>', it will fail but
you won't break anything. It was not the case before 0.8.10 :-)

<h2><a name="11.6">11.6 Relaunching the judge</a></h2>

<p>- Run '<tt>dipclean</tt>' (especially after upgrading)

<p>- Go into the '<tt>dip/</tt>' directory, unlock the judge ('<tt>flock</tt>') and test it!

corporations to eat and pay the mortgage, and is trying to learn Java, C and PHP
(The most difficult part is to find some time for it...)

<h2><a name="12.2">12.2 Thanks</a></h2>

<p> Many parts of this HowTo are cut-and-pasted from <tt>README</tt> and <tt>INSTALL</tt>files,
from source code and from mails of the judge-maint mailing list.

<p> Thanks to Philippe Lalande, JK of Frog, who was soooooo patient with
all my questions on the judge, and the members of the judge-maint mailing-list.
