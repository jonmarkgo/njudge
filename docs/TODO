 This file contains wishlists, open bugs, work in progress on the 
judge code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
IN PROGRESS:   

- 25th Jan. 2001, from Tim Miller:

On DEMA:
Some more Machiavelli bug fixes (ownership
mainly)
Machiavelli Basic rules (no money)
Machiavelli2 rules and map
MachHo1 variant (similar to SailHo with 4 powers)
Machiavelli results enhancement (to show clearly
owning powers and owned countries)

On USTV:
Colonial Dip with Advanced Rules (Suez, TSR and
Hong Kong)
1900 variant
Blind variant (using an external program to
preprocess results to remove other countries
results)
AnyBuild (allowing units to be maintained,
disbanded or built in a build phase)
Abstraction2 with A/F rules (early phase, not yet
completed)

- Documentation update (C.Courtois)

- Merge FAQs, install-howto, README files... into an
Administrator Guide (C.Courtois)

- help files translations (C.Courtois)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:

- Makefile : copy docs/ too ?

- BUGS file : whatisit ?

- LICENSE must be written by someone who knows who owns what in
the judge code (David Kovar ?)

- Latecount bug (McBob 25th jan 2002)

- GPL violation in strdup.c
(P.Lalande 6th Jan 2002) : All three fonctions strdup, strncasecmp, 
and strcasecmp appears in my 
distribution of linux in the <string.h> include. If it is the case with the 
other platform, my guess is that we could simply remove those files from 
the compilation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
WISHLIST:

- Diary to make EOGs easier ; Millis thinks it is not so difficult 
(C.Courtois 25th Jan 2002)
- Delete registrations without altering dip.whois and dip.addr (Tim Miller 22th Jan 2002)
