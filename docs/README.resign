The code ignores the password of an observer as long as the return
address matches.  If the address the judge has for the observer is 
bogus, you can still sign onto it with a fake return address by 
including a "Reply-To: bogus_address" prior to the "OBSERVE" command.

(Note:  the "please resign me" issue can now be resolved by the Master
using the "EJECT email_address" command.)
