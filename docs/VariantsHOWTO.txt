                                1 Introduction

1.1 History

   - 0.2 : Mar-Apr 2003

1.2 Last version

   This is a guide which aims to help people creating variants for the
   Diplomacy judge.
   The reference version is the HTML version. The text should be
   automatically generated against the HTML.
   Anyway, the last version of this file should always be in the last CVS
   snapshot of the judge at [38]http://www.njudge.org/.

1.3 Why?

   There seems to lack documentation on how to make a variant. [39]David
   Norman provides some useful help but I think that many things shoudn't
   need to go through him now that everyone can have a judge at home.

   I'll try to sum up here most knowledge on variants creation, beginning
   by the basic ones, made from existing maps. I won't cover variants
   with new rules not yet implemented in the judge.

   All this was tested on a njudge v.1.3.2-pre from April 2003.

                          2 What you can and must do

2.1 Possibilities

   Trivial "almost-variants" without recompilation needed are:
     * Add maps for wings or blind options to existing variants (see
       [40]Special seed files).
     * Change start units positions of existing variants (see [41]Seed
       files), but it will not be compatible with the 'official' set of
       variants.

   Easy variants covered here are:
     * Variants with an existing map slightly modified
     * Variants with a simple map
     * Variants with new powers

   A bit more difficult, which will lead you to use MapMaker and perhaps
   contacting David Norman:
     * Variants with totally new and complex maps

   You'll have to understand the code of the judge yourself for changing
   any rule...

   And creating the map files and pictures if currently out of subject.

2.3. Variant options

   There are variants based on maps, like standard, modern, h32... , and
   there are the variant options or modifiers: Wings, Gunboat, Blind,
   Shorthand. See the info file for each of them, but basically Shorthand
   and Gunboat only affect press, while Blind and Wings may have impact
   on map files.

                               3 Data to provide

   For a complete new variant, you MUST provide this:
   Warning : from 1.4, all files follow the same naming scheme; seed and
       report use variant names like maps now. -- CC
     * Map file: this lists the territories, the way they communicate
       with each other, the order which must be used in summary reports.
       Example: data/map, data/map.loeb9
     * Seed file : this lists the units beginning positions and what are
       the home centers.
       Example: data/seed.1
     * Report file : this file is sent at game start, giving the initial
       positions.
       Example: data/report.38

   You MUST modify theses files in the source code of the judge:
     * variant.h
     * variant.c

   And you MAY provide these files, but the judge will work without them.
   They will be necessary for the players though.
     * Info file: It contains the differences between the standard game
       and the variant.
       Example: data/info.wings, data/info.h32
     * Rules file: Only if you create a whole new game.
       Example: data/rules.machiavelli

   There are some additional files to modify to package a new variant
   into the official judge, see later.

3.1. Map files

   A map file is in the data/ subdirectory. The name is
   map.<variant_name>.

   The format is fully described by a document from Sergio Lidsell that
   is part of the judge package: [42]njudgemapdatahowto.htm. Following
   are juste examples from the standard map to sum it up.

  3.1.1 Declaration of lands and centers

   Switzerland,
   (Neutral land) l swi switz swiss
   (Possible names)
   Adriatic Sea,
   (Sea)                           w adr adriatic
   Ankara,
   (Home center of T)              T ank ankar
   Belgium,
   (Neutral center with sea shore) xw bel belgi

  3.1.2 Movements

   swi-mv:
   (Switzerland, no possible move) swi

   adr-xc:
   (Between a coast and its neighbours) alb apu ven tri ion

   bud-mv:
   (Between a land and its neighbours) vie gal rum ser tri

   con-mv:
   con-xc:
   (Special case for Constantinophe) bul ank smy
   bul/sc bul/ec bla ank smy aeg

  3.1.3 ordering for summaries (optional)

   Center order for summary report:
     ven rom nap tun edi lon lvp bre par mar por spa bel hol mun kie ber
     den swe nor stp war mos sev con ank smy bul rum gre ser bud vie tri
   #End of center ordering

  3.1.4 Other optional data

   Hong Kong flag, railways, and so on, are described in
   [43]njudgemapdatahowto.htm. For a good example, see map.colonial.

3.2 Seed file

  3.2.1 Seed file format

   The seed file is in the data/ subdirectory. The name is
   seed.<variant_number>. (The variant number is obtained when modifying
   the source; see below).

   The first line contains the first game season. This is a redundancy
   with what is in variant.c, but both sources must give the same value.
   If the seed file and variant.c don't match on the start season, the
   judge will crash at the first resolution of orders. (Even if the test
   disappears some day, the file format probably won't change to preserve
   variant files compatibility with [DEL: obsolete :DEL] old judges).
   Then follow the positions of the units at the start of the game for
   each power, and the centers that each player possess at the beginning.
   On the standard map you obtain (file seed.1):

   S1901M
   A: A Budapest
   A: A Vienna
   A: F Trieste
   E: A Liverpool
   E: F Edinburgh
   ...
   T: F Ankara
   -1 Null ownership/contested record will initialize from the map data.
   -1

   The last line indicates the start position of each power. In the
   standard game and most variants, it is not given, and the home centers
   are the one occupied by units.

  3.2.2 When units do not begin on home centers

   Another example is the seed for the Chaos variant (seed.5) :

   F1900B
   -1
   ....A....BC..DEF..GH.I....J...K..LN.PQ.RST...U.V..W.X.YZ0..1234.56....
   78.9..
   -1

   There is no unit at the beginning. Each character is a territory. Each
   dot is one without a unit, and letters and numbers indicate the power
   who possess the center at the beginning. There is no list of units
   ready to begin, and the first season is Fall, so the players must
   begin by building a unit.

   For the last version of the Hundred variant, called h32 (seed.22) we
   have:

   S1425M
   B: A Dijon
   B: A Flanders
   B: A Luxembourg
   B: F Holland
   E: A Calais
   E: A Guyenne
   E: A Normandy
   E: F English Channel
   E: F London
   F: A Dauphine
   F: A Orleanais
   F: A Paris
   F: A Toulouse
   F: A Provence
   -1
   ........E...FEB.B.EB..E.B..E..FF.......F.
   -1

   In this seed, France begins with 5 units on the board, but possess
   only 4 centers, and will have to gain a center in the first year to
   avoid to disband a unit.

  3.2.3 Special seed files (seed_b, seed_w...)

   There are special seed files for the special variants options (wings,
   gunboat...). For example, a variant with the wings option can have a
   seed file ending by _w. If such a file does not exist, the standard
   seed file is used, and the game begins without any wing units on the
   board. The only seed file with such a property currently in the source
   tree is seed_w.19, the wings version of the Modern variant. It is the
   same file as seed.19, except that some units at the beginning are
   planes (see info.wings):

   B: W London
   F: W Bordeaux

   There is no example of a seed_b or seed_bw file, although all is in
   place in the judge code to use it (it may be removed in the future).
   There is little point in having special seed files for Blind
   variants...

  3.2.4 In the code

   The part of the code responsible for opening the seed file is
   ml_signon.c. Probably the place to change for the one who wants to
   have seed.<variant> instead of seed.<number>.

3.3 Info files

   The info<variant> contains all informations on your variant:
   differences against the standard map, new units or territory, special
   territories, starting positions and home centers, default variant
   modifiers (wings...), supply centers and how many must be won, who
   made the variant... See other info files as example.

   They are useful only for the players, who will get them with get
   info.<variant>. The judge itself doesn't need them.

3.4 Variant.c and variant.h

   These two files are part of the source code of the judge. Any
   modification implies that that judge must be recompiled. Here follows
   all possible modifications in these files, in the order where you'll
   meet them in the code.

  3.4.1 Variant.c: Variants array

   In variant.c, search char *variants[]: this array contains the user
   names of the variants. You must add yours at the end, BEFORE the name
   of the variant modifiers. Don't forget the comma.

  3.4.2 Variant.c: VValue array

   Just after that, you must define another line of the array vvalue.

  3.4.3 Variant.c: Powers array

   If you add any power name, add it at the end of the array powers.

  3.4.4 Variant.c: Owners array

   - If you have add any power, add the possessive form in the array
   owners, in the same order.

  3.4.5 Variant.c: pletter array

   - The pletter contains the abbreviations (F for France, 9 for Warsaw
   in a chaos...) for the powers in your variant. You must add a line
   even if no new power name was added. For a simple variant, you can cut
   and paste the line of another variant.

   If new power were added, ALL lines of all variants must be expanded.

  3.4.6 Variant.c: Sphase array

   - The sphase array contains the start season of the variant. It must
   be the same one as in the seed file that you have created.

  3.4.7 Variant.h: Variants array

   In variant.h, in the first enum field, you must add a new V_ line. If
   you didn't count it before, this array's comments contain each variant
   number, that you must use for seed and report files.

  3.4.8 Variant.h: magic numbers

   You may have to update these 'magic numbers' if you really have to,
   especially the second one if you find something more insane than a
   chaos (and you'll have to find yourself if lowercase letters are OK
   for power names...):
   /** UPDATE DEFINES AS NECESSARY BELOW **/
   #define NVAROPTS 4 /* Number of variant options
   (blind/gunboat/shorthand/a/f) */
   #define MAX_POWERS 36 /* Max. powers in a single game (letters+digits)
   */
   #define LPOWER 24 /* Length of the longest power name */

  3.4.9 Variant.h: SETNP macro and default modifiers

   The macro SETNP contains the default behaviour of your variant: number
   of players, victory points. You must add a line for yours too.

   The line for the standard (7 players by default, 18 centers to win)
   is:

   case V_STANDARD: dipent.np = 7; dipent.vp = 18; break; \

   Many variant modifiers can be added as the default setup of the
   variant. Most can be overriden at game creation by a SET commande.
   These many modifiers are defined in the file dip.h. Some well known
   are:
     * XF_BUILD_ANYCENTRES: a power can build on any center, like in a
       Chaos variant. Same as the moderator command SET ANY
       CENTRE[S]|CENTER[S].
     * XF_BUILD_ONECENTRE: the player can build anywhere, but needs to
       own at least one home center, like in Classical or Aberration.
     * XF_COASTAL_CONVOYS: allows coastal convoys, like in Machiavelli.
       Same as the moderator command SET [NO] COASTAL CONVOYS.

   Other more or less useful modifiers are: XF_MANUALPROC,
   XF_NOMINORPRESS, XF_AUTODISBAND, XF_ANYDISBAND...

   Don't forget the \ at the end of the line.

starter.flist

   This file lists almost all files from data/. You must add there your
   info, seed, report files.

                                  4 Examples

4.1 H32 (Hundred) Wings

  4.1.1 Setup

   H32 (Hundred Years War) with wings seems at first sight stupid, but I
   think the game would be changed by it. We need for this the seed_w
   file to place the first wings, and the report_w file to let it know to
   the players. We need just to copy the seed.22 and report.22 as
   seed_w.22 and report_w.22, and modifying them for example this way:
     * seed_w.22:
       B: A Dijon
       B: W Flanders
       B: A Luxembourg
       B: F Holland
       E: A Calais
       E: A Guyenne
       E: A Normandy
       E: F English Channel
       E: W London
       F: A Dauphine
       F: A Orleanais
       F: A Paris
       F: W Toulouse
       F: A Provence
     * report_w.22:
       Starting position for Spring of 1425.
       Burgundy:Army Dijon.
       Burgundy:Wing Flanders.
       ...
       France: Wing Toulouse.
       France: Army (unpaid and angry) Provence.

   Add seed_w.22 and report_w.22 to starter.flist in the source file
   directory.

   For this small variant, you don't need anything more. You can test it
   immediately:

   create ?testh32w password h32 wings
   set players 1

  4.1.2 Test

   Create a new game by sending to the judge:

   create ?test password h32 wings
   set players 1

   And as Burgundy, you'll be able to send your planes from Flanders
   directly to London.

4.2 Test variant

  4.2.1 Setup

   This variant is called Mytest and aims to be almost the same as the
   standard.

   - See in variant.h what is the biggest variant number. It is 34
   (colonial96) for my 1.3.2-pre judge, so it will be variant number 35.
   Create seed.35 and report.35 by copying seed.1 and report.1. Adjust
   this value if you have another judge with more or less variants.

   - Create the info.mytest file.

   - Add the following lines in the variants array of variant.c:

   "colonial96", /* Colonial 1996 Diplomacy */
   "mytest", /* Test !!!! */
   /** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/

   - In the vvalue array:

   V_colonial96, /* 34 Colonial 1996 variant */
   V_mytest, /* 35 Test */
   /** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/

   - The powers and owners don't change.

   - Add a line similar to the one of the standard variant to the pletter
   array:

   ".xxBxxCxxxxFxxxxxxJxxxxxxxRxxxTxxHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?xOM", /* Colonial 1996
   Diplomacy */
   ".AxxxxxxxExFGxxxxIxxxxxxxxRxxxTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?xOM", /* MyTest variant
   */
   /** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/

   - The start season in sphase must be the same as in the seed file:

   "S1870M", /* Colonial 1996 Diplomacy */
   "S1901M", /* My test */
   /** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/

   - In variant.h, expand the enum this way:

   V_colonial96, /* 34 Colonial 1996 Diplomacy */
   V_mytest, /* 35 my test */
   /** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/
   NVARIANT /* Last variant + 1 */

   - In the SETNP macro, add this line (here we'll have 7 players, 10
   victory points only; disband is allowad at any turn, and a retreat
   leads automatically to a disband):

   case V_mytest: dipent.np = 7; dipent.vp = 10; dipent.xflags |=
   XF_ANYDISBAND ; dipent.xflags |=XF_AUTODISBAND ;break; \

   - It's over for the code modification.

  4.2.2 Installation

   You should read the upgrade documentation (for example my
   [44]Installation guide) to avoid losing your specific configuration
   and some mail of you have an active judge. Basically, you have to do
   this:

   **** FIXME ***** A VALIDER !!!!!! (histoire avec num de vrsion)

   - The quick and dirty way is to modify directly the Makefile (change
   the VERSION variable from it standard version to 1.3.2+custom variants
   for example), and install info.mytest, seed.35 and report.35 into the
   data/ directory of your current running judge.

   - The Right Way, compulsory if you have are coming from a fresh
   tarball, is to :

   - change the version number in configure.ac (see README.hackers for
   details):
   AC_INIT("njudge", 1.3.2.020030413+variants) ; or change the Makefile
   after lauching

   - add your variant files to the starter.flist.

   - You must get the smail.in and defaults.inc.in from your old judge
   source if they are not standard.

   - Then compile and upgrade. On my system it means:

   ./configure --with-dir=/home/alex/dip --with-user=alex
   --with-domain=christophecourtois.org
   make all
   make upgrade

  4.2.3 Test

   Create the game:

   create ?foobar password mytest
   set players 1

4.3 Switzerland

   Let's imagine that Switzerland is a territory like any other one.

4.4 Chess

                                  5 floc.net

                                  6 Mapmaker

   DN : There are a number of files you need - a map, a report, a seed
   and an info file, plus you have to update the variant.h (and variant.c
   in the newer versions of the judge). It can be done without MapMaker.
   But by using MapMaker : (1) It takes a fraction of the time (2) You
   get Mapper, Mapit and a PS map too (3) You get floc.net support And
   also, you get my experience of getting a variant through draft
   versions without confusing the various systems that run around the
   judges...

                                   7 Addmap

                               8 Automatic tests

   None known. David Norman may have some.
