1.1 History

   - 0.1 : Mar 2003

1.2 Last version

   This is a guide which aims to help people creating variants for the
   Diplomacy judge alone.
   The reference version is the HTML version. The text should be
   automatically generated against the HTML.
   Anyway, the last version of this file should always be in the last CVS
   snapshot of the judge at [3]http://www.njudge.org/.

1.3 Why?

   Creating a variant is almost impossible for someone alone. [4]David
   Norman provides some useful help but many things don't need to go
   through him now that everyone can have a judge at home.

   None known. David Norman may have some.

                              8. Troubleshooting

   These are some problems and solutions:

12.1 The author

   The author is 28 years old, writes SQL all day long for big
   corporations to eat and pay the mortgage, and is trying to learn Java,
   C and PHP (The most difficult part is to find some time for it...)

12.2 Thanks

   Many parts of this HowTo are cut-and-pasted from source code and mails
   of the judge-maint mailing list.
