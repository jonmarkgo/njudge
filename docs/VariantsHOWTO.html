<h1><a name="1">1 Introduction</a></h1>

<h2><a name="1.1">1.1 History</a></h2>

<p>- 0.2 : Mar-Apr 2003

<h2><a name="1.2">1.2 Last version</a></h2>

<p> This is a guide which aims to help people creating variants for the Diplomacy judge.

<br>The reference version is the HTML version.  The text should be
automatically generated against the HTML.
<br>Anyway, the last version of this file should always be in the last CVS
snapshot of the judge at <a href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a>.

<h2><a name="1.3">1.3 Why?</a></h2>

<p> There seems to lack documentation on how to make a variant.
<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/">David Norman</a> provides some useful help but I think
that many things shoudn't need to go through him now that everyone can have a judge at home.

<p> I'll try to sum up here most knowledge on variants creation, beginning by the basic
ones, made from existing maps.  I won't cover variants with new rules not yet implemented in the judge.

<p> All this was tested on a njudge v.1.3.2-pre from April 2003.

<h1><a name="2">2 What you can and must do</a></h1>

<h2><a name="2.1">2.1 Possibilities</a></h2>

<p> Trivial "almost-variants" without recompilation needed are:
<ul type=square>
<li> Add maps for wings or blind options to existing variants (see <a href="#2.2.3">Special seed files</a>).
</li>
<li> Change start units positions of existing variants (see <a href="#2">Seed files</a>),
but it will not be compatible with the 'official' set of variants.
</li>
</ul>

<p> Easy variants covered here are:
<ul type=square>
<li> Variants with an existing map slightly modified</li>
<li> Variants with a simple map</li>
<li> Variants with new powers</li>
</ul>

<p> A bit more difficult, which will lead you to use MapMaker and perhaps contacting David Norman:
<ul type=square>
<li> Variants with totally new and complex maps</li>
</ul>

<p> You'll have to understand the code of the judge yourself for changing any rule...

<p> And creating the map files and pictures if currently out of subject.

<h2><a name="2.3">2.3. Variant options</a></h2>

<p> There are variants based on maps, like <tt>standard, modern, h32</tt>... , and there are the variant
options or modifiers: <tt>Wings, Gunboat, Blind, Shorthand</tt>. See the <tt>info</tt> file for each of
them, but basically <tt>Shorthand</tt> and <tt>Gunboat</tt> only affect press, while <tt>Blind</tt> and
<tt>Wings</tt> may have impact on map files.


<h1><a name="3">3 Data to provide</a></h1>

<p> For a complete new variant, you MUST provide this:
<ul type=square>
<li> <b>Map file</b>: this lists the territories, the way they communicate with each other, the order
which must be used in summary reports.
<br>Example: <tt>data/map, data/map.loeb9</tt>
</li>
<li> <b>Seed file</b> : this lists the units beginning positions and what are the home centers.
<br>Example: <tt>data/seed.1</tt>
</li>
<li> <b>Report file</b> : this file is sent at game start, giving the initial positions.
<br><br>Example: <tt>data/report.38</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<p> You MUST modify theses files in the source code of the judge:
<ul type=square>
<li> <tt>variant.h</tt></li>
<li> <tt>variant.c</tt></li>
</ul>

<p> And you MAY provide these files, but the judge will work without them.  They will be necessary
for the players though.
<ul type=square>
<li> <b>Info file</b>: It contains the differences between the standard game and the variant.
<br>Example: <tt>data/info.wings, data/info.h32</tt>
</li>
<li> <b>Rules file</b>: Only if you create a whole new game.
<br>Example: <tt>data/rules.machiavelli</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<p> There are some additional files to modify to package a new variant into the official judge, see later.


<h2><a name="3.1">3.1. Map files</a></h2>

<p> A map file is in the <tt>data/</tt> subdirectory.  The name is <tt>map.&lt;<i>variant_name</i>&gt;</tt>.

<p> The format is fully described by a document from Sergio Lidsell that is part of the judge package:
<a href="njudgemapdatahowto.htm">njudgemapdatahowto.htm</a>.  Following are juste examples from the
standard map to sum it up.

<h3><a name="3.1.1">3.1.1 Declaration of lands and centers</a></h3>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><tt>Switzerland,</tt><br>(Neutral land)<td><tt>l  swi switz swiss</tt><br>(Possible names)
<tr><td><tt>Adriatic Sea,</tt><br>(Sea)<td><tt>w  adr adriatic
<tr><td><tt>Ankara,</tt><br>(Home center of T)<td><tt>T  ank ankar
<tr><td><tt>Belgium,</tt><br>(Neutral center with sea shore)<td><tt>xw  bel belgi
</table>

<h3><a name="3.1.2">3.1.2 Movements</a></h3>

<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><tt>swi-mv:</tt><br>(Switzerland, no possible move)<td><tt>swi</tt><br>&nbsp;

<tr><td><tt>con-mv:<br>con-xc:</tt>
<br>(Special case for Constantinophe)<td><tt>bul ank smy<br>bul/sc bul/ec bla ank smy aeg</tt><br>&nbsp;
</table>

<h3><a name="3.1.3">3.1.3 ordering for summaries (optional)</a></h3>

<p><tt>Center order for summary report:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;ven rom nap tun edi lon lvp bre par mar por spa bel hol mun kie ber
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;den swe nor stp war mos sev con ank smy bul rum gre ser bud vie tri
<br>#End of center ordering
</tt>

<h3><a name="3.1.4">3.1.4 Other optional data</a></h3>

<p> Hong Kong flag, railways, and so on, are described in <a href="njudgemapdatahowto.htm">njudgemapdatahowto.htm</a>.
 For a good example, see <tt>map.colonial</tt>.

<h2><a name="3.2">3.2 Seed file</a></h2>

<h3><a name="3.2.1">3.2.1 Seed file format</a></h3>

<p> The seed file is in the <tt>data/</tt> subdirectory.  The name is <tt>seed.&lt;<i>variant_number</i>&gt;.
(The variant number is obtained when modifying the source; see below).

<p> The first line contains the first game season.  This is a redundancy with what is in <tt>variant.c</tt>,
but both sources must give the same value.  If the <tt>seed</tt> file and <tt>variant.c</tt> don't match
on the start season, the judge will crash at the first resolution of orders. (Even if the test disappears
some day, the file format probably won't change to preserve variant files compatibility with <s>obsolete</s> old
judges).
<br> Then follow the positions of the units at the start of the game for each
power, and the centers that each player possess at the beginning.  On the standard map you obtain (file <tt>seed.1</tt>):

<p><tt>S1901M
<br>A: A Budapest
<br>A: A Vienna
<br>A: F Trieste
<br>E: A Liverpool
<br>E: F Edinburgh
<br>...
<br>T: F Ankara
<br>-1 Null ownership/contested record will initialize from the map data.
<br>-1
</tt>

<p> The last line indicates the start position of each power.  In the standard game and most variants,
it is not given, and the home centers are the one occupied by units.

<h3><a name="3.2.2">3.2.2 When units do not begin on home centers</a></h3>

<p> Another example is the seed for the Chaos variant (<tt>seed.5</tt>) :
<p><tt>F1900B
<br>-1
<br>....A....BC..DEF..GH.I....J...K..LN.PQ.RST...U.V..W.X.YZ0..1234.56....78.9..
<br>-1
</tt>

<p> There is no unit at the beginning.  Each character is a territory.  Each dot is one without a unit,
and letters and numbers indicate the power who possess the center at the beginning.  There is no list of
units ready to begin, and the first season is Fall, so the players must begin by building a unit.

<p> For the last version of the Hundred variant, called h32 (<tt>seed.22</tt>) we have:

<p><tt>S1425M
<br>B: A Dijon
<br>B: A Flanders
<br>B: A Luxembourg
<br>B: F Holland
<br>E: A Calais
<br>E: A Guyenne
<br>E: A Normandy
<br>E: F English Channel
<br>E: F London
<br>F: A Dauphine
<br>F: A Orleanais
<br>F: A Paris
<br>F: A Toulouse
<br>F: A Provence
<br>-1
<br>........E...FEB.B.EB..E.B..E..FF.......F.
<br>-1
</tt>

<p> In this seed, France begins with 5 units on the board, but possess only 4 centers, and will have to
gain a center in the first year to avoid to disband a unit.

<h3><a name="3.2.3">3.2.3 Special seed files (seed_b, seed_w...)</a></h3>

<p> There are special seed files for the special variants options (wings, gunboat...).
 For example, a variant with the wings option can have a seed file ending by <tt>_w</tt>.  If
such a file does not exist, the standard seed file is used, and the game begins without any wing units
on the board.  The only
seed file with such a property currently in the source tree is <tt>seed_w.19</tt>, the wings version
of the Modern variant.  It is the same file as <tt>seed.19</tt>, except that some units at the beginning
are planes (see <tt>info.wings</tt>):
<p><tt>B: W London
<br>F: W Bordeaux
</tt>

<p> There is no example of a <tt>seed_b</tt> or <tt>seed_bw</tt> file, although all is in place in the
judge code to use it (it may be removed in the future).  There is little point in having special
seed files for Blind variants...

<h3><a name="3.2.4">3.2.4 In the code</a></h3>

<p> The part of the code responsible for opening the seed file is <tt>ml_signon.c</tt>.  Probably the
place to change for the one who wants to have <tt>seed.&lt;variant&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>seed.&lt;number&gt;</tt>.

<h2><a name="3.3">3.3 Info files</a></h2>

<p> The <tt>info&lt;variant&gt;</tt> contains all informations on your variant: differences against the standard map,
new units or territory, special territories, starting positions and home centers,
default variant modifiers (wings...), supply centers and how many must be won, who made the variant... See
other <tt>info</tt> files as example.
<p> They are useful only for the players, who will get them with <tt>get info.&lt;variant&gt;</tt>.  The
judge itself doesn't need them.

<h2><a name="3.4">3.4 Variant.c and variant.h</a></h2>

<p> These two files are part of the source code of the judge.  Any modification implies that that judge
must be recompiled.  Here follows all possible modifications in these files, in the order where you'll
meet them in the code.

<h3><a name="3.4.1">3.4.1 Variant.c: Variants array</a></h3>
<p> In <tt>variant.c</tt>, search <tt>char *variants[]</tt>: this array contains the user names
of the variants.  You must add yours at the end, BEFORE the name of the variant modifiers.  Don't
forget the comma.

<h3><a name="3.4.2">3.4.2 Variant.c: VValue array</a></h3>
<p> Just after that, you must define another line of the array <tt>vvalue</tt>.

<h3><a name="3.4.3">3.4.3 Variant.c: Powers array</a></h3>
<p> If you add any power name, add it at the end of the array <tt>powers</tt>.

<h3><a name="3.4.4">3.4.4 Variant.c: Owners array</a></h3>
<p>- If you have add any power, add the possessive form in the array <tt>owners</tt>, in the same order.

<h3><a name="3.4.5">3.4.5 Variant.c: pletter array</a></h3>
<p>- The <tt>pletter</tt> contains the abbreviations (F for France, 9 for Warsaw in a chaos...) for
the powers in your variant.  You must add a line even if no new power name was added.  For a simple
variant, you can cut and paste the line of another variant.
<p> If new power were added, <b>ALL</b> lines of all variants must be expanded.

<h3><a name="3.4.6">3.4.6 Variant.c: Sphase array</a></h3>
<p>- The <tt>sphase</tt> array contains the start season of the variant.  It must be the same one as
in the <tt>seed</tt> file that you have created.

<h3><a name="3.4.7">3.4.7 Variant.h: Variants array</a></h3>
<p> In <tt>variant.h</tt>, in the first enum field, you must add a new <tt>V_</tt> line.  If you didn't
count it before, this array's comments contain each variant number, that you must use for <tt>seed</tt>
and <tt>report</tt> files.

<h3><a name="3.4.8">3.4.8 Variant.h: magic numbers</a></h3>

<p> You may have to update these 'magic numbers' if you really have to, especially the second one if you
find something more insane than a chaos (and you'll have to find yourself if lowercase letters are OK
for power names...):
<br><tt>/** UPDATE DEFINES AS NECESSARY BELOW **/
<br>#define NVAROPTS       4        /* Number of variant options (blind/gunboat/shorthand/a/f) */
<br>#define MAX_POWERS    36        /* Max. powers in a single game (letters+digits) */
<br>#define LPOWER        24        /* Length of the longest power name              */
</tt>

<h3><a name="3.4.9">3.4.9 Variant.h: SETNP macro and default modifiers</a></h3>
<p> The macro <tt>SETNP</tt> contains the default behaviour of your variant: number of players,
victory points.  You must add a line for yours too.
<p> The line for the standard (7 players by default, 18 centers to win) is:
<p> <tt>case V_STANDARD:    dipent.np =  <b>7</b>; dipent.vp = <b>18</b>; break;          \</tt>
<p> Many variant modifiers can be added as the default setup of the variant.  Most can be overriden
at game creation by a <tt>SET</tt> commande. These many modifiers are defined in the file <tt>dip.h</tt>.
Some well known are:
<ul type=square>
<li><tt>XF_BUILD_ANYCENTRES</tt>: a power can build on any center, like in a Chaos variant.  Same
as the moderator command <tt> SET ANY CENTRE[S]|CENTER[S]</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>XF_BUILD_ONECENTRE</tt>: the player can build anywhere, but needs to own at least one home center,
like in Classical or Aberration.
<li><tt>XF_COASTAL_CONVOYS</tt>: allows coastal convoys, like in Machiavelli.  Same as the moderator
command <tt>SET [NO] COASTAL CONVOYS</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p> Other more or less useful modifiers are: <tt>XF_MANUALPROC, XF_NOMINORPRESS,  XF_AUTODISBAND,
XF_ANYDISBAND</tt>...

<p> Don't forget the \ at the end of the line.

<h2><a name="3.5">starter.flist</a></h2>

<p> This file lists almost all files from <tt>data/</tt>.  You must add there your <tt>info, seed, report</tt>
files.

<h1><a name="4">4 Examples</a></h1>

<h2><a name="4.1">4.1 H32 (Hundred) Wings</a></h2>

<h3><a name="4.1.1">4.1.1 Setup</a></h3>

<p> H32 (Hundred Years War) with wings seems at first sight stupid, but I think the game would be changed
by it.  We need for this the <tt>seed_w</tt> file to place the first wings, and the <tt>report_w</tt> file
to let it know to the players.  We need just to copy the <tt>seed.22</tt> and <tt>report.22</tt>
as <tt>seed_w.22</tt> and <tt>report_w.22</tt>, and modifying them for example this way:
<ul type=square>
<li><tt>seed_w.22:
<br>B: A Dijon
<br>B: <b>W</b> Flanders
<br>B: A Luxembourg
<br>B: F Holland
<br>E: A Calais
<br>E: A Guyenne
<br>E: A Normandy
<br>E: F English Channel
<br>E: <b>W</b> London
<br>F: A Dauphine
<br>F: A Orleanais
<br>F: A Paris
<br>F: <b>W</b> Toulouse
<br>F: A Provence
</tt>
</li>
<li><tt>report_w.22:
<br>  Starting position for Spring of 1425.
<br>
<br>Burgundy:Army Dijon.
<br>Burgundy:<b>Wing</b> Flanders.
<br>...
<br>France: <b>Wing</b> Toulouse.
<br>France: Army (unpaid and angry) Provence.
</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<p> Add <tt>seed_w.22</tt> and <tt>report_w.22</tt> to <tt>starter.flist</tt> in the source file directory.

<p> For this small variant, you don't need anything more.  You can test it immediately:
<p><tt>create ?testh32w password h32 wings
<br>set players 1
</tt>

<h3><a name="4.1.2">4.1.2 Test</a></h3>

<p> Create a new game by sending to the judge:
<p><tt>create ?test password h32 wings
<br>set players 1</tt>

<p> And as Burgundy, you'll be able to send your planes from Flanders directly to London.

<h2><a name="4.2">4.2 Test variant</a></h2>

<h3><a name="4.2.1">4.2.1 Setup</a></h3>

<p> This variant is called Mytest and aims to be almost the same as the standard.

<p>- See in <tt>variant.h</tt> what is the biggest variant number. It is 34 (colonial96)
for my 1.3.2-pre judge, so it will be variant number 35. Create <tt>seed.35</tt> and <tt>report.35</tt>
by copying <tt>seed.1</tt> and <tt>report.1</tt>.  Adjust this value if you have another judge with more
or less variants.

<p>- Create the <tt>info.mytest</tt> file.

<p>- Add the following lines in the <tt>variants</tt> array of <tt>variant.c</tt>:
<p><tt>        "colonial96",           /* Colonial 1996 Diplomacy         */
<br>        <b>"mytest",               /* Test !!!! */</b>
<br>/** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/
</tt>

<p>- In the <tt>vvalue</tt> array:
<p><tt>        V_colonial96,           /* 34 Colonial 1996 variant          */
<br>        <b>V_mytest,               /* 35 Test */</b>
<br>/** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/
</tt>

<p>- The <tt>powers</tt> and <tt>owners</tt> don't change.</li>
<p>- Add a line similar to the one of the standard variant to the <tt>pletter</tt> array:
<p><tt>    ".xxBxxCxxxxFxxxxxxJxxxxxxxRxxxTxxHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?xOM",  /* Colonial 1996 Diplomacy */
<br>    <b>".AxxxxxxxExFGxxxxIxxxxxxxxRxxxTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?xOM",  /* MyTest variant */</b>
<br>/** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/
</tt>

<p>- The start season in <tt>sphase</tt> must be the same as in the <tt>seed</tt> file:
<p><tt>           "S1870M",               /* Colonial 1996 Diplomacy         */
<br>        <b>"S1901M",               /* My test  */</b>
<br>/** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/
</tt>

<p>- In <tt>variant.h</tt>, expand the enum this way:
<p><tt>        V_colonial96,           /* 34 Colonial 1996 Diplomacy        */
<br>        <b>V_mytest,               /* 35 my test */</b>
<br>/** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/
        <br>NVARIANT                /* Last variant + 1                  */
</tt>

<p>- In the SETNP macro, add this line (here we'll have 7 players, 10 victory points only; disband
is allowad at any turn, and a retreat leads automatically to a disband):
<p><tt>case V_mytest:    dipent.np =  7; dipent.vp = 10; dipent.xflags |= XF_ANYDISBAND ; dipent.xflags |=XF_AUTODISBAND ;break;  \
</tt>

<p>- It's over for the code modification.



<h3><a name="4.2.2">4.2.2 Installation</a></h3>


<p> You should read the upgrade documentation (for example my <a href="InstallationHOWTO.html">Installation guide</a>)
to avoid losing your specific configuration and some mail of you have an active judge.  Basically,
you have to do this:

<p>**** FIXME ***** A VALIDER !!!!!! (histoire avec num de vrsion)


<p>- The quick and dirty way is to modify directly the <tt>Makefile</tt> (change the <tt>VERSION</tt>
variable from it standard version to <tt>1.3.2+custom variants</tt> for example), and install
<tt>info.mytest</tt>, <tt>seed.35</tt>
and <tt>report.35</tt> into the <tt>data/</tt> directory of your current running judge.

<p>- The Right Way, compulsory if you have are coming from a fresh tarball, is to :
<p> - change the version number in <tt>configure.ac</tt> (see <tt>README.hackers</tt> for details):
<br><tt>AC_INIT("njudge", 1.3.2.020030413+variants)</tt> ; or change the Makefile after lauching
<p> - add your variant files to the <tt>starter.flist</tt>.
<p> - You must get the <tt>smail.in</tt> and <tt>defaults.inc.in</tt> from your old judge source if they
are not standard.

<p>- Then compile and upgrade.  On my system it means:
<p><tt>./configure --with-dir=/home/alex/dip --with-user=alex --with-domain=christophecourtois.org
<br>make all
<br>make upgrade
</tt>

<p>
DN :
There are a number of files you need - a map, a report, a seed and an info
file, plus you have to update the variant.h (and variant.c in the newer
versions of the judge).

It can be done without MapMaker. But by using MapMaker :

(1) It takes a fraction of the time
(2) You get Mapper, Mapit and a PS map too
(3) You get floc.net support

And also, you get my experience of getting a variant through draft versions
without confusing the various systems that run around the judges...
