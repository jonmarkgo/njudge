<h2><a name="1.2"></a>1.2 Last version</h2>
<p>This is a guide which aims to help people creating variants for
the Diplomacy judge. <br>
The reference version is the HTML version.
The text should be automatically generated against the HTML. <br>
Anyway,
the last version of this file should always be in the last CVS
snapshot of the judge at <a href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 Why?</h2>
<p>There seems to lack documentation on how to make a variant. <a
 href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/">David
Norman</a> provides some useful help but I think that many things
shoudn't need to go through him now that everyone can have a judge at
home. </p>
<p>I'll try to sum up here most knowledge on variants creation,
beginning by the basic ones, made from existing maps. I won't cover
variants with new rules not yet implemented in the judge. </p>
<p>All this was tested on a njudge v. 1.4.1 from June 2003. </p>
<h1><a name="2"></a>2 What you can and must do</h1>
<h2><a name="2.1"></a>2.1 Possibilities</h2>
<p>Trivial "almost-variants" without recompilation needed
are: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Add maps for wings or blind options to existing variants (see <a
 href="#2.2.3">Special seed files</a>).</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Change start units positions of existing variants (see <a
 href="#2">Seed files</a>), but it will not be compatible with the
'official' set of variants. </li>
</ul>
<p>Easy variants covered here are: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Variants with an existing map slightly modified </li>
  <li>Variants with a simple map</li>
  <li>Variants with new powers </li>
</ul>
<p>A bit more difficult, which will lead you to use MapMaker and
perhaps contacting David Norman: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>
    <p>Variants with totally new and complex maps </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You'll have to understand the code of the judge yourself for
changing any rule... </p>
<p>And creating the map files and pictures if currently out of
subject. </p>
<h2><a name="2.3"></a>2.3. Variant options</h2>
<p>There are variants based on maps, like <tt>standard, modern,
h32</tt>... , and there are the variant options or modifiers: <tt>Wings,
Gunboat, Blind, Shorthand</tt>. See the <tt>info</tt> file for each
of them, but basically <tt>Shorthand</tt> and <tt>Gunboat</tt> only
affect press, while <tt>Blind</tt> and <tt>Wings</tt> may have impact
on map files. </p>
<h1><a name="3"></a>3 Data to provide</h1>
<p>(<b>Warning</b>: Some file names changed with judge 1.4; many old
judges will use numbers instead of variant name as an extension).</p>
<p>For a complete new variant, you MUST provide this: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><b>Map file</b>: this lists the
territories, the way they communicate with each other, the order which
must be used in summary reports. <br>
Example: <tt>data/map, data/map.loeb9</tt> </li>
  <li><b>Seed file</b> : this lists the units
beginning positions and what are the home centers. <br>
Example: <tt>data/seed.loeb9</tt></li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Report file</b> : this file is sent at
game start, giving the initial positions. <br>
    <br>
Example: <tt>data/report.loeb9</tt></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You MUST modify theses files in the source
code of the judge: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><tt>variant.h</tt> </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>variant.c</tt> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>And you MAY provide these files, but the
judge will work without them. They will be necessary for the players
though. </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><b>Info file</b>: It contains the
differences between the standard game and the variant. <br>
Example: <tt>data/info.wings, data/info.h32</tt> </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Rules file</b>: Only if you create a
whole new game. <br>
Example: <tt>data/rules.machiavelli</tt> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are some additional files to modify to
package a new variant into the official judge, see later. </p>
<h2><a name="3.1"></a>3.1. Map files</h2>
<p>A map file is in the <tt>data/</tt>
subdirectory. The name is <tt>map.&lt;<i>variant_name</i>&gt;</tt>. </p>
<p>The format is fully described by a document
from Sergio Lidsell that is part of the judge package:
<a href="njudgemapdatahowto.htm">njudgemapdatahowto.htm</a>.
Following are just examples from the standard map to sum it up. </p>

<h3><a name="3.1.2"></a>3.1.2 Movements</h3>
<p>A line must be created for each movement
type allowed for a province, land routes (mv) and sea routes (xc). If
a province has only one specified, it is not reachable by the other
(i.e. A land-locked province such as Munich only has a land route
specified).</p>
<p>Fleets use sea-routes (which also specify
allowed coasts if relevant) and all non-fleet units use land routes.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1.3"></a>3.1.3 ordering for
summaries (optional)</h3>
<p>This specifies how centres are groups in the
summary report ('summary &lt;gamename&gt;'). They can be in any
arbitrary order desired, thoguh it is normal to group them by
home-owner and geographical proximity to aid legibility.</p>
<p><tt>Center order for summary report: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ven

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;den swe nor stp war mos sev con ank smy bul rum gre

#End of center ordering </tt>
</p>
<h3><a name="3.1.4"></a>3.1.4 Other optional
data</h3>
<p>Hong Kong flag, railways, and so on, are
described in <a href="njudgemapdatahowto.htm">njudgemapdatahowto.htm</a>.
For a good example, see <tt>map.colonial</tt>. </p>
<h2><a name="3.2"></a>3.2 Seed file</h2>
<h3><a name="3.2.1"></a>3.2.1 Seed file format</h3>
<p>The seed file is in the <tt>data/</tt>
subdirectory. The name is <tt>seed.&lt;<i>variant_name</i>&gt;. </tt>
</p>
<p>The first line contains the first game
season. This is a redundancy with what is in <tt>variant.c</tt>, but
both sources must give the same value. If the <tt>seed</tt> file and
<tt>variant.c</tt> don't match on the start season, the judge will
crash at the first resolution of orders. (Even if the test disappears
some day, the file format probably won't change to preserve variant
files compatibility with <strike>obsolete</strike> old judges). <br>
Then
follow the positions of the units at the start of the game for each
power, and the centers that each player possess at the beginning. On
the standard map you obtain (file <tt>seed.standard</tt>): </p>
<p><tt>S1901M <br>
A: A Budapest <br>
A: A
Vienna <br>
A: F Trieste <br>
E: A Liverpool <br>
E: F Edinburgh <br>
...
<br>
T: F Ankara <br>
-1 Null ownership/contested record will
initialize from the map data. <br>
-1 </tt>
</p>
<p>The last line indicates the start
position of each power. In the standard game and most variants, it is
not given, and the home centers are the one occupied by units. </p>
<h3><a name="3.2.2"></a>3.2.2 When units do
not begin on home centers</h3>
<p>Another example is the seed for the
Chaos variant (<tt>seed.chaos</tt>) :<tt> </tt>
</p>
<p><tt>F1900B <br>
-1
<br>
....A....BC..DEF..GH.I....J...K..LN.PQ.RST...U.V..W.X.YZ0..1234.56....78.9..
<br>
-1 </tt>
</p>
<p>There is no units at the beginning. Each
character is a territory. Each dot is one without an owner, and
letters and numbers indicate the power who possess the center at the
beginning. There is no list of units ready to begin, and the first
season is a build phase, so the players must begin by building a
unit. </p>
<p>For the last version of the Hundred
variant, called h32 (<tt>seed.h32</tt>) we have:<tt> </tt>
</p>
<p><tt>S1425M <br>
B: A Dijon <br>
B: A
Flanders <br>
B: A Luxembourg <br>
B: F Holland <br>
E: A Calais <br>
E:
A Guyenne <br>
E: A Normandy <br>
E: F English Channel <br>
E: F London
<br>
F: A Dauphine <br>
F: A Orleanais <br>
F: A Paris <br>
F: A Toulouse
<br>
F: A Provence <br>
-1 <br>
........E...FEB.B.EB..E.B..E..FF.......F.
<br>
-1 </tt>
</p>
<p>In this seed, France begins with 5 units
on the board, but possess only 4 centers, and will have to gain a
center in the first year to avoid to disband a unit. </p>
<h3><a name="3.2.3"></a>3.2.3 Special seed
files (seed_b, seed_w...)</h3>
<p>There are special seed files for the
special variants options (wings, gunboat...). For example, a variant
with the wings option can have a seed file ending by <tt>_w. </tt>If
such a file does not exist, the standard seed file is used, and the
game begins without any wing units on the board. The only seed file
with such a property currently in the source tree is <tt>seed_w.modern</tt>,
the wings version of the Modern variant. It is the same file as
<tt>seed.modern</tt>, except that some units at the beginning are
wings (see <tt>info.wings</tt>): </p>
<p><tt>B: W London <br>
F: W Bordeaux</tt> </p>
<p>There is no example of a seed_b
or seed_bw file, although all is in place in the judge code
to use it (it may be removed in the future). There is in any case
little point in having special seed files for Blind variants... </p>
<h3><a name="3.2.4"></a>3.2.4 In the code</h3>
<p>The part of the code responsible for
opening the seed file is <tt>ml_signon.c</tt>. </p>
<h2><a name="3.3"></a>3.3 Info files</h2>
<p>The <tt>info.&lt;variant&gt;
</tt>contains all informations on your variant: differences against the
standard map, new units or territory, special territories, starting
positions and home centers, default variant modifiers (wings...),
supply centers and how many must be won, who made the variant... See
other info files as example. </p>
<p>They are used as reference files for the
players, providing information about the variant, and are retrieved
with the judge command '<tt>get info.&lt;variant&gt;</tt>'.
The judge
itself doesn't need them. </p>
<h2><a name="3.4"></a>3.4 Variant.c and
variant.h</h2>
<p>These two files are part of the source
code of the judge. Any modification implies that that judge must be
recompiled. Here follows all possible modifications in these files,
in the order where you'll meet them in the code. </p>
<h3><a name="3.4.1"></a>3.4.1 Variant.c:
Variants array</h3>
<p>In variant.c, search<tt> char
*variants[]</tt>: this array contains the user names of the
variants.
You must add yours at the end, BEFORE the name of the variant
modifiers. Don't forget the comma. </p>
<h3><a name="3.4.2"></a>3.4.2 Variant.c:
VValue array</h3>
<p>Just after that, you must define a
define for the variant (used later in <tt>variant.h</tt>). Any name is
permitted, though by convention it is of the form
<tt>V_&lt;variant-name&gt;</tt>.
</p>
<h3><a name="3.4.3"></a>3.4.3 Variant.c:
Powers array</h3>
<p>If you add any power name, add it at the
end of the array <tt>powers</tt>. </p>
<h3><a name="3.4.4"></a>3.4.4 Variant.c:
Owners array</h3>
<p>If you have add any power, add the
possessive form in the array <tt>owners</tt>, in the same
order. </p>
<p>Note: the sizes of both <tt>powers </tt>and
<tt>owners </tt>array must match, otherwise you will get unexpected
names
used!</p>
<h3><a name="3.4.5"></a>3.4.5 Variant.c:
pletter array</h3>
The <tt>pletter</tt>
contains the
abbreviations (F for France, 9 for Warsaw in a chaos...) for the powers
in your variant. You must add a new line for your variant, defining
which power letters will be used. The position of these power letters
correspond to the position of the descriptive names in the powers and
onwers arrays, defined above. Powers that are not played in this
variant are represented by the 'x'.<br>
If new power(s) were added, ALL
lines of all variants must be extended to have the same number of
letters.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><a name="3.4.6"></a>3.4.6 Variant.c:
Sphase array</h3>
<p>- The <tt>sphase </tt>array contains the
start season of the variant. It must be the same one as in the seed
file that you have created. </p>
<h3><a name="3.4.7"></a>3.4.7 Variant.h:
Variants array</h3>
<p>In <tt>variant.h</tt>, in the first enum
field, you must add a new <tt>V_ </tt>line. If you didn't count it
before, this array's comments contain each variant number, that will
be used as the variant number in the <tt>dip.master </tt>file. </p>
<h3><a name="3.4.8"></a>3.4.8 Variant.h:
magic numbers</h3>
<p>You may have to update these 'magic
numbers' if you really have to, especially the second one if you find
something more insane than a chaos (and you'll have to find yourself
if lowercase letters are OK for power names...): <br>
</p>
<p><tt>/** UPDATE
DEFINES AS NECESSARY BELOW **/ <br>
#define NVAROPTS 4 /* Number of
variant options (blind/gunboat/shorthand/a/f) */ <br>
#define
MAX_POWERS 36 /* Max. powers in a single game (letters+digits) */
<br>
#define LPOWER 24 /* Length of the longest power name */</tt> </p>
<h3><a name="3.4.81"></a><a name="3.4.9"></a>3.4.9
WILD_PLAYER</h3>
<p>If you have added new powers, you MUST
increment this define accordingly by the number of powers added. The
subsequent defines should be values after this (in njudge 1.4.1
onwards, this is automatic). Failure to do this will commonly result
in the Master being called another name.</p>
<h3>3.4.10 Variant.h: SETNP macro and
default modifiers</h3>
<p>The macro <tt>SETNP </tt>contains the
default behaviour of your variant: number of players, victory points.
You must add a line for yours too. </p>
<p>The line for the standard (7 players by
default, 18 centers to win) is: </p>
<p><tt>case V_STANDARD: dipent.np = 7;
dipent.vp = 18; break; \</tt> </p>
<p>Many variant modifiers can be added as
the default setup of the variant. Most can be overriden at game
creation by a SET commande. These many modifiers are defined
in the file <tt>dip.h</tt>. Some well known are: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><tt>XF_BUILD_ANYCENTRES</tt>: a power
can build on any center, like in a Chaos variant. Same as the moderator
command <tt>SET ANY CENTRE[S]|CENTER[S]</tt>. </li>
  <li><tt>XF_BUILD_ONECENTRE</tt>: the player
can build anywhere, but needs to own at least one home center, like in
Classical or Aberration.</li>
  <li><tt>XF_COASTAL_CONVOYS</tt>: allows
coastal convoys, like in Machiavelli. Same as the moderator command<tt>
SET
[NO] COASTAL CONVOYS</tt>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other more or less useful modifiers are:
<tt>XF_MANUALPROC, XF_NOMINORPRESS, XF_AUTODISBAND, XF_ANYDISBAND</tt>...
</p>
<p>Don't forget the \ at the end of the
line. </p>
<h3><a name="3.5"></a>3.4.11 starter.flist</h3>
<p>This file lists almost all files from
<tt>data/</tt>. You shoul add there your info, seed, report
files, as it is used as a reference for players.<br>
</p>
<h1><a name="4"></a>4 Examples</h1>
<h2><a name="4.1"></a>4.1 H32 (Hundred)
Wings</h2>
<h3><a name="4.1.1"></a>4.1.1 Setup</h3>
<p><font color="#ff0000">(** FIXME : This part must ber updated with
variant names as extensions **)</font><br>
H32 (Hundred Years War) with wings seems
at first sight stupid, but I think the game would be changed by it.
We need for this the <tt>seed_w</tt> file to place the first wings,
and the <tt>report_w</tt> file to let it know to the players. We need
just to copy the <tt>seed.22</tt> and <tt>report.22</tt> as <tt>seed_w.22</tt>
and <tt>report_w.22</tt>, and modifying them for example this way: </p>

<p>Add <tt>seed_w.22</tt> and<tt> report_w.22</tt>
to <tt>starter.flist </tt>in the source file directory. </p>
<p>For this small variant, you don't need
anything more. You can test it immediately: </p>
<p><tt>create ?testh32w password h32 wings
<br>
set players 1</tt> </p>
<h3><a name="4.1.2"></a>4.1.2 Test</h3>
<p>Create a new game by sending to the
judge: </p>
<p><tt>create ?test password h32 wings <br>
set
players 1</tt> </p>
<p>And as Burgundy, you'll be able to send
your planes from Flanders directly to London. </p>
<h2><a name="4.2"></a>4.2 Test variant</h2>
<h3><a name="4.2.1"></a>4.2.1 Setup</h3>
<p><font color="#ff0000">(** FIXME : This part must ber updated with
variant names as extensions **)</font><br>
This variant is called Mytest and aims
to be almost the same as the standard. </p>
<p>- See in <tt>variant.h </tt>what is the
biggest variant number. It is 34 (colonial96) for my 1.3.2-pre judge,
so it will be variant number 35. Create <tt>seed.35</tt> and
<tt>report.35</tt> by copying <tt>seed.1 </tt>and <tt>report.1</tt>.
Adjust this value if you have another judge with more or less
variants. </p>
<p>- Create the <tt>info.mytest</tt> file. </p>
<p>- Add the following lines in the
variants array of <tt>variant.c</tt>: </p>
<p><tt>"colonial96", /* Colonial
1996 Diplomacy */ <br>
"mytest", /* Test !!!! */ <br>
/**
ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/</tt>
</p>
<p>- In the <tt>vvalue </tt>array: </p>
<p><tt>V_colonial96, /* 34 Colonial 1996
variant */ <br>
V_mytest, /* 35 Test */ <br>
/** ADD NEW
VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/</tt>
</p>
<p>- The powers and owners
don't change. </p>
<p>- Add a line similar to the one of the
standard variant to the pletter array: </p>
<p><tt>".xxBxxCxxxxFxxxxxxJxxxxxxxRxxxTxxHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?xOM",
/* Colonial 1996 Diplomacy */
<br>
".AxxxxxxxExFGxxxxIxxxxxxxxRxxxTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?xOM",
/* MyTest variant */ <br>
/** ADD NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE!
**/</tt>
</p>
<p>- The start season in <tt>sphase
</tt>must be the same as in the seed file: </p>
<p><tt>"S1870M", /* Colonial 1996
Diplomacy */ <br>
"S1901M", /* My test */ <br>
/** ADD
NEW VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/</tt>
</p>
<p>- In <tt>variant.h</tt>, expand the enum
this way: </p>
<p><tt>V_colonial96, /* 34 Colonial 1996
Diplomacy */ <br>
V_mytest, /* 35 my test */ <br>
/** ADD NEW
VARIANTS ABOVE THIS LINE! **/ <br>
NVARIANT /* Last variant + 1 */</tt>
</p>
<p>- In the <tt>SETNP</tt> macro, add this line
(here we'll have 7 players, 10 victory points only; disband is
allowad at any turn, and a retreat leads automatically to a disband):
</p>
<p><tt>case V_mytest: dipent.np = 7;
dipent.vp = 10; dipent.xflags |= XF_ANYDISBAND ; dipent.xflags
|=XF_AUTODISBAND ;break; \</tt> </p>
<p>- It's over for the code modification. </p>
<h3><a name="4.2.2"></a>4.2.2 Installation</h3>
<p>You should read the upgrade
documentation (for example my <a href="InstallationHOWTO.html">Installation
guide</a>) to avoid losing your specific configuration and some mail
of you have an active judge. Basically, you have to do this: </p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">**** FIXME ***** A VALIDER !!!!!!
(histoire avec num de vrsion)</font> </p>
<p>- The quick and dirty way is to modify
directly the <tt>Makefile </tt>(change the <tt>VERSION </tt>variable
from it standard version to 1.3.2+custom variants for
example), and install <tt>info.mytest</tt>, <tt>seed.35 </tt>and<tt>
report.35</tt> into the <tt>data/</tt> directory of your current
running judge. </p>
<p>- The Right Way, compulsory if you have
are coming from a fresh tarball, is to : </p>
<p>- change the version number in
<tt>configure.ac</tt> (see <tt>README.hackers</tt> for details):
<br>
<tt>AC_INIT("njudge", 1.3.2.020030413+variants)</tt> ;
or change the <tt>Makefile</tt> after lauching </p>
<p>- add your variant files to the
<tt>starter.flist</tt>. </p>
<p>- You must get the <tt>smail.in</tt> and<tt>
defaults.inc.in</tt> from your old judge source if they are not
standard. </p>
<p>- Then compile and upgrade. On my system
it means: </p>
<p><tt>./configure
--with-dir=/home/alex/dip --with-user=alex
--with-domain=christophecourtois.org <br>
make all <br>
make upgrade</tt> </p>

<h1><a name="5"></a>5 floc.net</h1>
<h1><a name="6"></a>6 Mapmaker</h1>
<p>DN : There are a number of files you
need - a map, a report, a seed and an info file, plus you have to
update the variant.h (and variant.c in the newer versions of the
judge). It can be done without MapMaker. But by using MapMaker : (1)
It takes a fraction of the time (2) You get Mapper, Mapit and a PS
map too (3) You get floc.net support And also, you get my experience
of getting a variant through draft versions without confusing the
various systems that run around the judges... </p>
