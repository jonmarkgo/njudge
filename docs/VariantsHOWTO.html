<p>- 0.1 : Mar 2003

<h2><a name="1.2">1.2 Last version</a></h2>

<p> This is a guide which aims to help people creating variants for the Diplomacy judge alone.

<br>The reference version is the HTML version.  The text should be
automatically generated against the HTML.
<br>Anyway, the last version of this file should always be in the last CVS
snapshot of the judge at <a href="http://www.njudge.org/">http://www.njudge.org/</a>.

<h2><a name="1.3">1.3 Why?</a></h2>


<h1><a name="7">7. Automatic tests</a></h1>

<p> None known.  David Norman may have some.

<h1><a name="8">8. Troubleshooting</a></h1>

<p>These are some problems and solutions:

<h2><a name="12.1">12.1 The author</a></h2>

<p> The author is 28 years old, writes SQL all day long for big
corporations to eat and pay the mortgage, and is trying to learn Java, C and PHP
(The most difficult part is to find some time for it...)

<h2><a name="12.2">12.2 Thanks</a></h2>

<p> Many parts of this HowTo are cut-and-pasted from source code and mails of the judge-maint mailing list.

<h2><a name="12.3">12.3 Copyright and boring stuff</a></h2>

recommended that the redistributor contact the author before the

(no translation known for the moment).
