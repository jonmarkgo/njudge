Sounds like you had a bailout.  Your .forward file should have been
renamed to zforward and new incoming mail should not be invoking the
rdip program.  Did I ever outline the procedure for recovering from
a bailout?  Anyway, it is:

   1) You should have a zforward file, new mail is going into the
      standard /usr/spool/mail (or equivalent) file and there are
      no more "dip"s running.

   2) Rename the saved_mail file to something like "t0" to prevent
      it from getting trashed.  Shouldn't be getting any more mail
      written to this file.

   3) Check in the log to determine why the bailout occured and fix
      the problem.

   4) Rename the zforward file to xforward.  The presence of the
      zforward causes all mail to be written to saved_mail.

   5) Make sure there is no "dip.input" file.  If your system went
      down while the judge was running this file may get left lying
      around.  It may contain partially processed mail.  You should
      determine whether there is any unprocessed mail in there and
      save it off to a file called "t1".

   6) Process the t0 file with:

          rdip < t0 &

      It will print the "From" lines out as it processes them so you
      can keep an eye on its progress.  While it is running you can
      continue with the next step.

   7) Verify that it doesn't bailout again.  If it does, go back up
      to step 2 and try again.

   8) Process the t1 file (if you've got one) with: "rdip < t1".
      You should get a "dip.input exists, exiting".  This is okay,
      the mail has been appended to dip.mail and will be processed
      by the earlier rdip when it catches up with its backlog.

   9) Rename the /usr/spool/mail/judge file to "t2" and process it
      with "rdip < t2".  Again you should get the "dip.input exists"
      message.

  10) Rename the xforward file to .forward.  If there are any new
      messages in /usr/spool/mail/judge you should process them with
      a rename to t3 and a "rdip < t3".

I'll add this to my release stuff as "README.bailout".
