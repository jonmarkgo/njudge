	* New build system using GNU autotools.

	* Added judge(6) man page (woefully incomplete.) Added
	README.hackers and revamped INSTALL to reflect new build system.

	* version.c: removed hardcoded string 'njudge'.  We get the
	package name and version from autoconf now.	

	* strdup.c: Replaced this GPL licensed file with OpenBSDs'
	implementation

	* makeflist: new script used during install process to create
	flist file.  Fixed a couple of invalid entries in starter.flist

	* smail: program locations now inserted by autoconf

	* newlogs: changed to use gzip by default.

	* Added Debian package infrastructure.
