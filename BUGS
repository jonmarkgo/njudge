This release has preliminary support for three new hundred variants.  But
the seed and report files aren't there, nor have the old hundred variants
been taken out of the code.  I advise against trying to run any type of
hundred variant unless you want to help debug it.

po_get.c needs the function get_amount() looked at by someone who can fix
machiavelli code.  there is an type overflow condition there, among other
things.

the flock/lockf stuff still screws up a sun.  the whole thing should be
changed to use posix fcntl stuff.
