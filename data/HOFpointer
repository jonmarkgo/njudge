At the time of writing (Nov 1994) the Hall of Fame included all judge
games completed, abandoned, or subject to excessive NMR in 1991-94.  A few
1988-90 judge games have been added, as well as some of the 1988-89 EP
games (EP#1-12) and the odd Genie and AOL game.  Over 770 games are now
listed.

Points are based on the formula Points = (N-W)/W    where N = # of players
(7 in standard, 10 in youngstown) and W is # of winners (1) or people
who shared in the draw.  Ie, in a standard game, 6.00 points for a win,
2.50 for a two-way draw,  1.33 for a three-way draw.  Chaos games
are deemed to have 20 players.

All judge games, and non-judge EP games are welcome for this list.  If
you have games that are missing, or incorrect, on this list please
inform the undersigned.
