Concessions

You may only concede in a DIAS game to the largest power on the board (in
noDIAS games, you can just set a one way draw). The correct format for the
command is:

set conc P

where P is the initial of the power you wish to concede to. Even though
you may only concede to the largest power on the board, the Judge requires
you to specify the power to be sure you really know who you are conceding
to. To cancel a concession aquiesence send:

set noconc
