Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                    3 February, 2003
Concessions.


You may only concede in a DIAS game to the largest power on the board (in
noDIAS games, you can just set a one way draw). The correct format for the
command is:

      SET CONC p

where "p" is the initial of the power you wish to concede to. Even though
you may only concede to the largest power on the board, the Judge requires
you to specify the power to be sure you really know who you are conceding
to. To cancel a concession setting, send:

     SET NOCONC

As with draws, concessions are cleared every time orders are processed, so
you need to re-set a concession (if you still want it) every phase.

Note that the player command must be written "SET [NO]CONC", and cannot be
spelled out in full, because the command "SET [NO]CONCESSION" is reserved for
use by the moderator to enable or disable the concession feature entirely.
