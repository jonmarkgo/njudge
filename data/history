Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                  3 February, 2003
history.


The "HISTORY" command can be used to retrieve all messages that an observer
would have seen had he been signed on to a particular game for a particular
time period.  The adjudicator stores turn results, broadcast press, and
informational notices (deadline adjustments, late notices, etc.), but NOT any
partial press.  (Note:  the history is not available in unfinished Blind
games, except to the game moderator.)

This command has two forms:

(1)  HISTORY [name] [FROM date] [TO date] [LINES n]

     This form retrieves the history information for the specified game
     ("name") for the specified time period (in real time rather than game
     time).  The default period is 1 week ago to the present.  If the HISTORY
     command follows a valid SIGNON command, then it is not necessary to
     specify "name", as the signed on game is assumed.

     Dates can be specified in the following forms (only spaces should be
     used to separate parts of a date, except a comma is optionally allowed
     after the day of the month):

          a)  Day of week (three-letter abbreviation)
          b)  Day and month (three-letter abbreviation), or month and day
          c)  Day, month, and year, or month, day, and year, where year
              can be specified either as 80-99 (= 1980-1999) or four digits.

     Also, a time in hours and minutes (i.e., 'hh:mm' form, using a 24-hour
     clock) can be added after any of the above if desired; otherwise, the
     time defaults to midnight (00:00) of the specified day.

     To get the earliest part of the history (or the whole history), use
     a date that is known to be earlier than the game start date; 1 Jan
     1990 (or Jan 1, 1990) is usually sufficient for this purpose.

     The LINES specifier can be used to limit (or increase) the number of
     lines that will be returned by the adjudicator.  The default is 1000.

     Examples:

          history foo from Jan 1, 2003

               will return history of game "foo" starting at midnight on Jan
               1, 2003, up to the end of the records (the present date) or
               1000 lines, whichever comes first.

          history foo from Jan 1, 1990 to Dec 31, 2002 23:59 lines 5000

               will return history of game "foo" from the start of the game
               up to a minute before midnight on Dec 31, 2002, or 5000 lines,
               whichever comes first.

          history foo to Dec 31, 2002 23:59

               will not perform as expected - if the start date is not
               specified, it defaults to the current system time minus seven
               days.  Since the end date is before the start date, it will be
               ignored.  Therefore, this command will produce the same
               results as "HISTORY FOO" with no arguments.

 (2)  HISTORY [name] EXCLSTART turnId [EXCLEND turnId] [BROAD]

     Retrieves the history information for the specified game excluding
     phases starting from EXCLSTART turnId [to EXCLEND turnId].

     Note: EXCLSTART is not optional.

     In the case where [EXCLEND turnId] is not specified, the returned
     history contains turns from start of game to (but not including)
     EXCLSTART turn.

     The format for 'turnId' is: SYYYYT
     where:  S - the season (ex: 'S' for Spring, or 'F' for Fall)
             Y - each digit in the year. (ex: 1901, 1425, 1999)
             T - Turn (ex: 'M' for Movement Phase, 'B' for builds, 'R' for
                 Retreats)

     Some examples of valid turnIDs:
             S1902M (Spring 1902 Movement Phase)
             F1999B (Fall 1999 Adjustment(Builds) Phase)

     No checking is done to determine whether the TurnIds given are
     actually found in the game.  The default action for erroneous turnIds
     is to return a history for the entire game.  If the EXCLSTART turnID is
     invalid, the EXCLEND turnID will be ignored.

     Examples (assuming that "foo" is a Standard game):

          history foo exclstart S2999M

               Return the complete history.

          history foo exclstart S1903M

               Return the history for game-years 1901 and 1902 only.

          history foo exclstart S1899M exclend F1905B

               Return the history from game-year 1906 to the end of the
               records.

     By default 'Diplomacy notices' are not included. However, if a draw
     notice is found outside the excluded set of phases the draw notice
     will be included.

     The optional "BROAD" specifier will cause notices included in the
     history.  In the worst case, with the BROAD command, the returned
     message can be anywhere from 200 Kb to as much as 1 Mb.
     (BEWARE! using this flag.)
