INTRODUCTION
Machiavelli is a board game by Avalon Hill.  It is similar to Diplomacy,
but more complicated.  The original release was by Battleline Publ. in 1978
and it is that version that was adapted for use by the Judge.  Avalon Hill
has printed three editions: 1st ed. 1980, 2nd ed. 1983 (reprint with new
board and chits and no bankers) and 2nd ed. 1995 (yes this is correct it
is a new edition and has major changes).  
The Battleline and Avalon Hill editions are now out of print so unless
you've already got one it is not likely that you'll find a copy of it.
This document is not a simple rehash of the official rules.  The official 
rules are unfortunately in many cases unclear and incomplete.  As the 
computerized judge version was encoded it became obvious that the official 
rules partly needed to be rewritten and clarified.  The result was this 
document.  The reader is cautioned that the rules in this document take 
precedence over the original rules in judge play. 
In addition to the above this document is also a description (by 
permission) of the game mechanics that should be enough to get you started, 
especially if you're familiar with the rules of Diplomacy or similar games.
A PostScript map is available via the adjudicator with the "get
machiavelli.ps" command or on various sites on the Internet.
The time frame of Machiavelli is Renaissance Italy from 1385 to 1529.

The main changes from standard Diplomacy are (also see appendix 3):
     1) Three movement seasons: spring, summer and fall.
     2) New order types.
     3) Province control rules (supply centers). (Classic rules.)
     4) Convoy rules.
     5) Garrison unit and siege rules.
     6) Powers have finances. (Advanced rules)
     7) The use of money to buy, build, disband and maintain units. (Adv.)
     8) Famine and plague events. (Adv.)
     9) Bribery. (Adv.)
    10) Special (multistrength) units. (Adv.)


ADVANCED AND BASIC RULES
Machiavelli comes with two sets of rules: 'Basic' and 'Advanced'.  
Advanced rules are an extension to the Basic rules.  It is the 
advanced rules that have traditionally been used on the judges.

Basic rules do *not* include money and disasters, so point 1, 2 and 8
above and the use of special units / multistrength units do not apply.  
In Basic you can only own one unit per controlled city after the fall 
moves have been executed if you *also* control the province that the 
city is located in.

To further complicate the issue AH released a second edition 
Machiavelli in 1995 ("Machiavelli2") that contains some major rule 
changes.  Thus according to the 1995 rules you must have one of your 
units present in a province at the end of, fall  to gain control of 
said province (as in standard Diplomacy).  There are also other 
changes that are described in "rules.machiavelli2".

'Tech note'.  Actually disasters are also not allowed in the basic 
rules but you may choose to allow those on the judge.


PROVINCES
The word "province" is used in the following to both denote *provinces
containing cities* and *provinces with no cities*.  Where the existence of
a city makes a difference it is hopefully clearly noted.
There are 70 provinces and 11 sea areas in all editions except AH1995 2nd
ed. which has 64 provinces and 9 sea areas.


GAME YEAR
A year in Machiavelli is comprised of three "campaigns" - Spring, Summer
and Fall - which are equivalent to the seasons of Diplomacy.  This
adjudicator processes movement and retreat phases for each of these seasons
and an adjustment phase at the end of the Fall season.
'Tech note'.  Original Machiavelli lists the adjustment phase at the
beginning of Spring, but for practical purposes it is regarded to occur
after fall as in standard diplomacy.


MOVEMENT
Unless explicitly contradicted herein, the rules of standard Diplomacy
apply to Machiavelli.  The judge implementation of Mach also uses the
standard Diplomacy movement notation: unittype startprov order endprov.
This will also solve some problems caused by omissions/vagueness in the
original Battleline Machiavelli rules.
Orders to besiege, lift siege and convoy can not be broken unless the unit
so ordering is dislodged.  Two units may reside in the same province if one
is garrisoned in the city and the other is outside the city in the province
proper (except "Venice", see under special mapboard features).

Retreats differ from diplomacy as listed below:
     1) Retreats are *not* allowed into a rebelling city (locked city gates).
     2) Retreats are allowed into a rebelling province.
     3) Rebelling units can not and do not support retreats.
     4) Retreating units liberate rebellions (if the rebellion is not 
        directed against the retreating power-then it remains). 
     4) Multistrength units (the elites) are treated as normal one-strength
        units during retreat (thus this is a bounce: a mil m pav,
        elite a tur m pav).

You may *disband* any unit at *any time*. On the nJudge this feature is 
controlled by the 'set disband' flag (q.v.).

If you try to *self-bounce* one of your multistrength units with one of 
your one strength units the multistrength unit's move will succeed 
and the other unit will bounce.

Notice that a garrison and an army or fleet in the *same province* cannot 
*trade places*. E.g. G PISA C A at the same time asF PISA C G is not 
allowed regardless of units strengths.

Nor can two units *trade provinces* with each other. E.g. F PISA M PIO at 
the same time as A PIO M PISA is not allowed regardless of units strengths.

'Tech note' 1.  In original Machiavelli you would instead note: unitserial
order endprov.  Original rules are also very vague about conflicts.  As
what happens when a power orders two of his units to move to the same
province.

'Tech note' 2.  In the original rules nothing is said about trading places.


CONVOYS
Fleets may convoy even if they are in coastal provinces.  On the nJudge 
this feature is controlled by the 'set coastalconvoys' flag (q.v.).  Armies 
must start and finish in coastal provinces.  Convoys cannot jump coasts.


ADDITIONAL UNITS
Rather than getting one unit per owned supply center units are paid for out
of the treasury.  Only units that the player chooses to maintain survive
through the adjustments phase.  There are no limits on how many *normal*
units you may build and have in play.  Also see special units.  Fleets may
only be built in cities that are ports.


GARRISON UNITS
Machiavelli introduces a unit type called, "garrison", which occupies
"fortified cities" or "fortresses".  Fortified cities are the filled in
squares on the map.  Fortresses are the outlined squares and their use is
optional.
A city can be garrisoned by ordering an army or a fleet in a province
containing an unoccupied city to "convert" during a movement phase.  The
garrison thus created can only hold, support actions into its corresponding
province or convert back to a fleet or army.
Under certain circumstances retreats into garrison are allowed (see
conversions).


AUTONOMOUS GARRISONS
At the start of some scenarios fortresses and/or fortified cities contain
"autonomous garrisons" which are units not owned by any player.  They act
as obstacles and must be besieged or bribed to be removed.  You may of
course also buy them to get an additional unit.
Do note that they affect city ownership for elimination purposes as any
ordinary garrison would.
Notice that special units retain their 'specialness' if you bribe them to 
turn autonomous. Thus you may e.g. create an elite autonomous garrison! 


SPECIAL UNITS (OPTIONAL)
The military units in the game are all assumed to be of the standard
composition of the times; that is, mainly composed of mercenaries who
fought (usually no harder than necessary) for money, and were highly
susceptible to bribes, as their allegiance went to the highest bidder.
Some military units of different composition did appear during this time,
and the following three unit types represent them.  Each power may only
have one special unit in play at any one time.
Orders that violate this limit automatically fail, and the money is lost.
Special units may be of any type: armies, fleets or garrisons.

a) Citizen's Militia:
     1) Cost 6 ducats, rather than 3, to build and maintain.
     2) Has a strength of 1.
     3) Cost twice the normal amount to bribe.

b) Elite Mercenaries:
     1) Cost 6 ducats, rather than 3, to build and maintain.
     2) Has a strength of 2.
     3) May be bribed for the normal amount.

c) Elite Professionals:
     1) Cost 9 ducats, rather than 3, to build and maintain.
     2) Has a strength of 2.
     3) Cost twice the normal amount to bribe.

Special characteristics of units with the strength of 2:
     1) Have twice the normal strength for moves, holds, and supports.
     2) Have their support *entirely cut* by a unit of strength 1.
     3) Cannot dislodge any besieger in the second siege season.
        (also see Conversion... below)
     4) Are only counted as strength 1 units during retreats.


SIEGES
To displace a garrison it must be besieged.  To besiege a garrison, an army
or fleet in the containing province must issue the besiege order for two
consecutive campaigns.  Fleets can only besiege port cities.  A fleet must
move to the containing province to be able to besiege a port city.

A besieged garrison (one whose city's siege started during the previous
campaign) cannot convert regardless of strength (also see Conversion...
below), although it can support another unit moving into its province to 
displace the besieging unit.

To successfully conclude a siege the besieging unit must also issue a 
besiege order in the following campaign. *Any other order* will automatically 
be converted to *hold* and *the siege will be aborted*.  When the siege is 
complete, the garrison is eliminated.  (Also see 'effects of assassination' 
for additional information.) You may formally end a siege by issuing a lift 
siege order, although you will still be holding in the province. 

In the following cases the siege lapses and the besieging unit is free to
issue other orders in what would be the second campaign of the siege (that
is - need not issue hold, lift siege or 2nd besiege order):
     1) If the garrison is eliminated (whatever the cause).
     2) If the garrison is disbanded by a bribe or the owning player.
        (Do note that if the bribe fails you are stuck with a hold order.)

'Self-sieges'.  As bribes are processed before moves you may issue a
besiege order on your own garrison, but, if the garrison remains yours,
the order will automatically be changed to 'hold'.  Should a similar
situation occur as a result of bribes the besiegeing unit will
automatically have its orders changed to 'lift siege'.


CONVERSION BETWEEN UNIT TYPES
Converting units are treated in the same way as a unit moving into or out
of the province.  Thus, if a garrison in, say, Genoa attempts to convert
into an army at the same time as another army moves into Genoa (and neither
one is supported), both will bounce and stay where they were.
Fleets can only convert to garrison and vice versa in port cities.  Fleets
may only retreat by conversion into port cities.
An army could convert into a garrison in the spring and that garrison could
then convert into a fleet in the subsequent summer or vice versa.  The army
or fleet can, however, not convert directly into a fleet or army in one
season.
Retreats and conversion: An army or fleet that is forced to retreat from a
province with an unoccupied fortified city or fortress can convert to a
garrison if, and only if, it has no other place to retreat to.  Of course
it can not retreat by converting into a garrison if the unit that displaced
it was a garrison converting into its location since you cannot retreat to
the location your attacker came from.

Clarification of the effects of conversion:
1) Successful conversions
     a) Garrisoning into a city *not* in rebellion.
     b) Converting into an empty province.
     c) Converting into an empty prov. attacked by a lesser force.
     d) Converting into a province occupied by a lesser force
          1) if the lesser force is not besiegeing.
          2) if the lesser force is issuing its *first* besiege order. 

2) Unsuccessful conversions
     a) Trying to garrison into a city *in rebellion*.
     b) Converting into a province attacked by an equal or superior force.
     c) Converting into a province occupied by an equal or superior force.
     d) Converting into a province occupied by a lesser force if the lesser 
        force is issuing its *second* besiege order (but the besieged unit
        may of course support another unit to enter the province and 
        dislodge the besieger).

Machiavelli 2 note: conversions are treated as attacks. Thus Points 1d2 and 
2d above are not applicable and only the strengths of the units count. 

'Tech note'.  It is a point of debate whether, under the original
Machiavelli rules, an army or fleet converting into a garrison is allowed
to bounce another unit attempting to move into its province and then
convert or if a garrison converting to an army or fleet into an unoccupied
province will convert first and then be able to move.  These rules
complicate things.  Using them, if you had an army and a garrison in Genoa,
you would have to move the army out of Genoa on one turn and wait until the
next movement phase before you could convert the garrison.  This
adjudicator treats the city as if it was a separate space on the map.


CONTROL OF PROVINCES AND CITIES
One major difference between standard Diplomacy and Machiavelli is that
changes of ownership in Machiavelli occur essentially constantly.
Keep this simple rule in mind: the last power whose unit was present in the
province always gains control (regardless of season or phase).

This means that:
     1) If you buy a unit you get control of the province too.
     2) If you disband in a province that contains an enemy unit, the enemy
        gains control.
     3) If you move away (or are eliminated) from a garrisoned province the
        power owning the garrison gains control of the province too.  This
        applies to autonomous garrisons as well.
     4) If both garrison and unit in province are eliminated simultaneously
        control does not change.
     5) If you enter a province with an ungarrisoned city you gain control
        of the city too.
     6) INCOME: If Power A controls the province and Power B controls the 
        (contained) city, the province income will go to Power A, while 
        the city income goes to Power B.
     7) BUILDS: A player must own both a home city and its surrounding 
        province in order to be able to build there. E.g. if one power has 
        a unit in the province, while another power has a unit in the city, 
        and both are simultaneously eliminated by famine or plague, neither 
        power will have build rights.

Example 1: if a unit is purchased, ownership of the province the unit is in
changes before the unit moves away.

Example 2: if a unit starts out in Genoa in the spring and moves to Fornova
and then to Parma in the summer and to Mantua in the fall, at the beginning
of the following adjustment phase that player would count the income for
all four provinces if no one else has moved into them.


CONTROL OF ANOTHER PLAYER'S HOME COUNTRY
Home countries are gained/lost in a block as they were defined at setup.
To gain control of another power's Home Country, you must gain control of
*all* its original provinces and cities.

Once a Home Country has lost its original controlling player it will be 
treated as a "Non Player Country" (NPC).

A power (actually a player) controlling one or more NPCs can lose its 
Original Home Country (as defined at setup) without being eliminated (see 
player elimination though) as one of the NPCs will automatically be treated 
as the new Home Country of that player.

A power (actually a player) controlling one or more NPCs will gain the 
Variable Income of each of those. The Variable Income can only be lost if 
another power gains control of any of the NPCs according to the rules in 
paragraphs one and two above. (See "Income Phase" below for more info.)


PLAYER ELIMINATION
A power/player who controls no cities in his home country at the end of a 
campaign is eliminated from the game and all of his units are immediately 
removed from the mapboard and all of his provinces and cities revert to 
unowned status.

If the player also controls several NPCs (see Control of another...) the 
rule above will only apply if all (remaining) cities of all his NPCs are 
lost simultaneously. In all other cases NPC elimination/control follow the 
"Control of another player's Home Country" rules.

Do note that autonomous garrisons affect control, but that rebellions do not.

WARNING: If Power A takes control of Power B's home area in the same season
that Power A loses control of all of its current home areas, Power A will
be eliminated.


VICTORY
To win in Machiavelli, you must control a certain number of home areas as
well as cities.  If the Master does not state otherwise in the listing, you
must control two home areas in addition to the listed number of cities.  It
is the responsibility of the GM to recognize when a victory has occurred.
It is recommended that the number of cities for victory be set to at least
23 - as that will qualify the game for the Hall of Fame - except for short
non-rated teaching games.

The standard victory limits are:
     1) Basic victory conditions is 12 cities and no additional home 
        countries.  You must control all of your home country cities 
        and at least six (6) other cities.
     2) Advanced victory conditions is 15 cities and two home 
        countries (incl. yours).
     3) Ultimate victory conditions is 23 cities and three home 
        countries (incl. yours).

'Tech note'.  The judge calculates required home countries thus: 
(cities+1)/8.  This translates for advanced games in: 1-7 cities = 1 HC, 
8-15 = 2 HCs, 16-23 = 3 HCs and 24-31 = 4 HCs.

IMPORTANT: The home country control requirement in 2) and 3) above only 
requires you to be in control of at least one city of any home country you 
are in control of. Thus if you are in control of Milan and Austria home 
countries you may win by controlling say MIL, TYR and 13 or 21 non-milanese 
and non-austrian cities!  Even if enemy units control any other province of 
said home countries and also besiege MIL and TYR!


SPECIAL MAPBOARD FEATURES AND RULES

1) Piombino and Messina
The province includes the offshore island of Elba.  The straits in-between
are not a separate sea, but are part of the Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea.  A fleet
in this province controls the straits between the mainland and the island.

A fleet in Messina controls the straits between Messina and Otranto.

Control is always with the fleet beginning the movement in any of the two 
provinces, and changes only after movement, but before retreats.  But see 
exceptions in c) and d).

Additional considerations about Piombino and Messina
     a) The power that controls Piombino or Messina and that has a fleet in 
        the same provinces will also control the straits. This means that 
        as long as there *already* is a fleet in either Messina or Piombino, 
        no hostile fleet can move, support or convoy between the Gulf of 
        Naples and the Ionian Sea or the Eastern Thyrrenian Sea and Pisa.
     b) If control of Piombino or Messina is divided between powers (that 
        is: contain a garrison of another power in addition to your fleet), 
        the power owning the fleet will control the straits.
     c) If a fleet successfully advances (that is: is *not bounced*) into a 
        *fleet-less* Piombino or Messina in the same turn as a hostile 
        fleet attempts to use the straits, the hostile fleet suffers all 
        effects described in a) above. (As if the entering fleet already 
        was in the province.)
     d) If a garrison successfully converts to fleet (that is: is *not 
        bounced*) into a *fleet-less* Piombino or Messina in the same turn 
        as a hostile fleet attempts to use the straits, the hostile fleet 
        suffers all effects described in a) above. (As if the entering 
        fleet already was in the province.)
     e) If a fleet is *ordered* to convert to garrison a hostile fleet 
        still suffers all effects described in a) above.  See h) too.
     f) If a fleet moves away from Piombino or Messina province a hostile 
        fleet still suffers all effects described in a) above.  See h) too.
     g) If a fleet moving away (or being ordered to garrison) from Piombino 
        or Messina province is bounced back into Piombino or Messina 
        province it will block a hostile fleet as per a) above. (The fleet 
        does in this case both comply with beginning control and ending 
        control rules.)
     h) A retreating fleet will suffer all effects described in a) above. 
        But a fleet *retreating into* Piombino or Messina, will *not* block 
        other fleets retreating through the straits (in the same turn).
        And neither will a fleet *forced* to retreat into garrison or 
        having been dislodged, as control has passed to the attackers fleet 
        or been lost if the attacker was an army.
     i) A fleet in Piombino or Messina may simultaneously be convoying or 
        supporting or besiegeing while it blocks a hostile fleet.
     j) Adjacency for bribe purposes is not affected by blocking fleets. 
     k) No player may use the straits without the controlling player's 
        permission.  A player wishing to allow another player to use the 
        straits must include an "ally" command with his movement orders.
     l) An army or garrison unit does not control the straits.

Notice that a fleet beginning in Piombino and that is dislodged, will be 
*destroyed* if the attacker is another fleet, as the entering fleet will 
control the straits at the time of retreat.

Notice also that in Machiavelli 2 the rules apply only to fleets in Messina 
and that rules c) and d) only apply to Classic Machiavelli (as the Mach2 
rules have no rule about fleets moving to Messina). 

'Tech note 1.' Rules c) and d) are there because the Classic machiavelli 
rules state that “Notes concerning Piombino and Messina: If a Fleet unit is 
ordered to, and makes, an advance into Piombino or Messina at the same time 
as a hostile Fleet tries to move or transport through the straits, the 
movement through the straits becomes impossible...”

'Tech note 2.' Why do retreats not affect fleet moves? Why should they? A 
retreating unit is not performing any offensive action. Any orders are 
annulled and all strengths are regarded as equal. Thus it would be odd if a 
fleet retreating into/from either Pio or Mes suddenly could take offensive 
action such as blocking other fleets. (Notice that all the judge versions 
previous to 1.7 let retreating units affect control as no distinction was 
made between normal moves and retreat moves in this special case.)

'Tech note 3.' An earlier revision of (current) rules e) and f), stated that 
if a fleet moved away (or converted to garrison) it lost control of the 
straits.  This was changed to make the rules more consistent with the 
control rules and the actual judge implementation.

2) Croatia and Provence
These provinces have a north and south coast that are treated just like the 
dual coast provinces in other variants of Diplomacy.

3) Istria and Dalmatia
These provinces are connected by a "land bridge".  An army can thus move
from Dalmatia to Istria or vice versa.

4) Venice Lagoon
Although small, the lagoon surrounding Venice is treated like an ordinary
sea space.

5) Venice province
As province and city occupy the same space Venice is handled somewhat
differently.
The following exceptions occur:
     a) Only *one* unit may be in Venice at any time.  Thus if there is a
        garrison there cannot be a fleet or an army or vice versa.
     b) In Venice you are not allowed to disband a unit of one type and
        build one of a different type.
     c) An army or fleet unit in Venice is always *unable to retreat* into
        the city in case of losing a combat (the loser will be eliminated
        as an attacker can only come from the lagoon).
     d) An army or fleet unit in Venice that is attacked by a unit of
        *greater strength* will be eliminated even if the unit attempted to
        convert to garrison (as no retreats are available). The attacker
        will gain Venice.
        If the attack is of equal or lesser strength, the conversion will
        succeed and the attacker will bounce.
     e) An attempted conversion to army or fleet by a garrison in Venice
        will bounce if Venice is attacked.  This is regardless of strengths.
     f) A garrison in Venice can never be besieged (as there can only be one
        unit there).
     g) No rebellion may be placed in Venice if there is a unit in Venice
        (regardless whether the unit is an army, fleet or garrison).
     h) Only *one* rebellion unit is placed in Venice, and then always in
        the city.
     i) A rebellion in Venice can never be besieged by the *affected* player
        as the rebelling unit will bounce any of his units (as there can
        only be one unit). However, any other player will 'put down' the
        rebellion and thus be able to move into Venice.

6) Port cities
Port cities are fortified cities or fortresses identified by an anchor
symbol on the map.

7) Fortresses
Fortresses (or forts for short) are optional fortified areas that can
be used in a scenario. Fortresses differ from ordinary cities by this:
     a) They generate *no* income.
     b) No garrisons may be built in them.
In all other respects fortresses are treated as ordinary fortified cities.
This means that rebellions may be placed in them, that you may garrison in
them and that some may be used as ports (look for the little anchor symbol).


SEQUENCE OF PLAY FOR ADJUSTMENT PHASES

1) Famine phase (optional).
Any province may be struck by famine.  First a 2d6 die roll determines the
severity:
     2, 3  No disaster
     4, 6  Good year, row only
     5, 7  Good year, column only
     8-12  Bad year, row and column

'Tech note'.  The rolls above reflect the actual judge coding.  According
to the original rules they should be 4 and 7 for good year row only and 5
and 6 for good year column only.

Then the list of provinces hit by famine is selected with one or two 2d6
die rolls on the "Famine Table":
         2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    12

The effects of famine are:
     a) Any unit in a famined province at the end of the spring movement is
        eliminated.  This includes garrison units.
     b) New units may not be built in famined provinces.
     c) Famine has no effect on control.
     d) A famined province will not produce income.
     e) A garrisoned city will always produce income.

Note that famine affected cities/provinces are noted with a "%" sign in the
results.

2) Income phase.
Each player receives income in the form of "ducats".  The income comes from
four sources:
     a) 1 ducat for each sea space that contains one of your fleets.
     b) 1 ducat for each controlled province.
     c) 1 ducat for each normal city controlled.  For major cities that
        contain a number: the number is the ducats received.  Do note that a
        besieged city produces *no* income.
     d) Variable income for each controlled home country and for certain
        cities.  Based on a 1d6 die roll.

If a player gains control of another player's home country, the variable
income of that home country is also gained.  Variable income is not
prevented by rebellions, sieges in progress, famines, loss of capital, or
any other factor as long as no third player takes control of the same home
country. (Also see the Control of another... section above.)

Ownership of the Genoa variable income roll is determined solely by
ownership of the city of Genoa.

The variable income in ducats for the major powers is:
        Power/city    dice    1  2  3  4  5  6  die roll
        ----------    ----    ----------------
        Austria:        1     1  2  3  3  4  4
        Florence:       2     1  2  3  3  4  5
        France/Marse:   1     1  2  3  4  5  6
        Genoa:          1     1  2  2  3  3  4
        Milan:          1     2  3  3  4  4  5
        Naples:         1     1  2  2  3  3  4
        Papacy/Rome:    1     2  3  3  4  5  6
        Turkey/Duraz:   1     1  2  3  4  5  6
        Venice:         2     2  3  3  4  4  5

'Tech note': The income above refers to the Machiavelli variant currently
run on the judges: The Balance of Power.  Other Machiavelli variants have
different income tables.

3) Military unit adjustments.
The adjudicator waits for adjustment orders at this point.  Each player
must choose which units he wishes to maintain or build.  Three (3) ducats
must be paid for each unit that is to remain on the map at the end of this
phase (also see special units).

Rules concerning builds:
     a) New units may only be placed in controlled provinces containing
        cities, in the players' home countries.  The unit may be placed
        either in the province *or* within a fortified city.  Fleets can
        only be placed in port cities.
     b) Only *one new* unit may be placed in a particular province.  If
        there is a unit in the city the new unit may be placed in the
        province or vice versa.
     c) You cannot place a *new* unit in both the city and the province -
        that is 2 units in the same province in the same adjustment phase.
     d) Old units may not be traded for new ones in the same province (that
        is disband a fleet and build an army or vice versa), but you may
        disband a garrison and build an army or fleet in the province or vice
        versa as noted in b).
     e) You cannot build new units in rebelling cities or provinces.
     f) You may build an unlimited number of units (also see special units)
        as long as you adhere to a-e above.
     g) Once units are paid for, they are paid for the entire year.  No
        further ducats need be paid for the units for the rest of the year,
        but also, no "refunds" of ducats are made for units that are
        eliminated or disbanded during the year.
     h) See also the section on Venice.
     i) See also the section on control over provinces and cities.

Each existing unit must be explicitly maintained or disbanded before the
adjudicator will consider your orders complete.  If you submit a "maintain"
order and change your mind, a subsequent "disband" order can be submitted
anytime before the phase is processed.  If you change your mind about a
previously submitted "build" order, it can be rescinded with a subsequent
"disband" order or an order to "build" a different type of unit in the same
province or within the city.  If you "disband" and change your mind you
must issue a "maintain" order for the same province to keep the previously
disbanded unit.


SEQUENCE OF PLAY FOR MOVEMENT PHASES

1) Plague phase (optional).
This is only done during the summer campaign.  The severity of plague is
determined in the same way as famine.  Plague is instantaneous and has no
duration in time.  The effect of plague is that all units in the plagued
provinces (and cities) are eliminated.

The list of provinces hit by plague is selected with one or two 2d6 die
rolls on the "Plague Table":
         2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    12

   11: Pianc Forno ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- Otran ----- Aquil Spole
   12: Trent Herze ----- Bresc ----- ----- ----- Corsi ----- Patri Saluz

2) The adjudicator waits for borrow, expenditure and movement orders.

3) Borrowing phase.
The first option during the expenditures phase is the borrowing of ducats.
Players may borrow up to a total maximum of 25 ducats from "the bank".  
You may choose whether to loan 1 ducat 25 times or all 25 ducats at once, 
or any combination in between.  The loan can either be for 1 year at 20% 
interest or for 2 years at 50% interest.  *Only* the fall income report 
will show when any outstanding loans are due.  The loan incl. interest 
must be repaid in full at the *end* of the borrowing phase of the
indicated season of the indicated year.  Loans may be repayed at any 
time before this according to the procedure below.  

Loan repayments are processed in this way:
     a) In the order shown in the income report.
     b) Always beginning with the interest of the earliest due loan.
     c) Then principal (non-interest part) of the earliest due loan.
     d) Then interest of 2nd earliest due loan (if any) and so on.

Notice that you are *not allowed to pick which loan to pay off first*.  
A new loan can be taken out to pay off the oldest loan as long as the
outstanding principal (the borrowed amount excl. interest) is within the
25 ducat limit.  
Careful planning must be executed to ensure that you don't default on the
loan.  If you are unable to pay off a loan, you'll be assassinated by the
bankers (see assassination for effects) and nevermore be allowed to borrow
from the bank.
In addition to borrowing from the bank, players may give/loan to each
other.  Loaning ducats to another player can be done during any borrowing
phase and happens before the bank collects any outstanding due loans.  The
receiving player (and any third party) will not know whether he really got
the loan until the phase is processed by the judge.  It is up to the player
if he wishes to repay a loan from another player.
A player who is in debt to the bank cannot loan money to another player
before paying off the debt to the bank.  Thus you cannot, as your last
dying gasp, borrow 25 ducats and give them to your ally.

The judge processes the pay/borrow commands in the following sequence:
     a) "Pay to bank" commands.
     b) "Pay to other player" commands (only if you are not indebted to the
        bank)
     c) "Borrow" commands.  (Total debt to bank, excl. interest, cannot
        exceed 25d.)
     d) Bank collects any due loans.
     e) Expenses processed

Example 1: You take a loan of 15 ducats in the Summer of 1492 for two
years.  By the Summer of 1494 you must pay 23 (15+8) ducats (interest is
always rounded up).  But if you only have 13 ducats in your treasury at the
beginning of the Summer 1494 borrowing phase you can take another loan of
10 ducats, during that phase, so that you have sufficient funds to pay off
the loan.

Example 2: If you have 20d and a 38 (25+13) ducats loan due, you *cannot*
borrow 18d to pay off that loan because you would temporarily exceed your
credit limit of 25 ducats even if you would have immediately dropped back
below it.  In this case you will need some other players help.  You can pay
the 20d toward the loan, changing it to 18+0d, then borrow 7d yourself, and
finally (hopefully) get a loan of 11d from other players to avoid getting
assassinated.  As paying to the bank comes first you can't use the money
received from other players to lower your loan in order to increase the
amount you can borrow.  However, if they gave you the money in the previous
season you would only need 6d.  With 26d and a 38 (25+13) ducats loan, you
can pay it off to 12+0d, allowing you to borrow up to 13d to pay off the
remaining 12d due.

Example 3: You regret that you borrowed from the bank and want to get rid
of the loan?  Just send the order "borrow 0 ducats for 1 year" or
"borrow 0 ducats for 2 years" (0=zero) depending on the loan you took.

'Tech note'.  Loans are for unknown reasons (probably an error) omitted 
from the AH 1983 rules edition.

4) Expenditures phase.
Each player can make up to four expenditures ("expense 1:", "expense 2:",
"expense 3:" and "expense 4:") during each campaign.  The ducats for the
expenditure are subtracted from the player's treasury.  If the expenditure
is invalid the cost of the expenditure is nevertheless subtracted from the
treasury.  Expenditures will be executed in their numerical order.  If the
treasury is insufficient to support all the expenditures (for example if an
expected loan from another player didn't come) the remaining treasury will
be used anyway.
You may remove an expenditure with the "none" order.  For example if you
want to remove expense number 2 you would issue the order "expense 2:
none".
If you instead want to change an expenditure you just issue a new
expenditure with the same number.  For example you have issued the order
"expense 1: 18 ducats buy a flore" but want to disband the unit instead.
to do that you just issue the order "expense 1: 12 ducats disband a flore".


LIST OF ALLOWED EXPENDITURES AND BRIBES
Expenditures a-c and j-l are not bribes and may not be counter-bribed.

a) Famine relief.
3 ducats.  This order is given to end the effects of famine in a province.
Example.  Expense 2: 3 ducats famine relief milan.

b) Pacify Rebellion.
12 ducats.  This order is given to end the effects of a rebellion in a
province.
Example.  Expense 1: 12 ducats pacify rebellion rome.

c) Counter-bribe.
Multiples of 3 ducats - 3 or 6 or 9 and so on.  This order is used to
nullify a suspected bribe attempt of a unit (expenditure d-i).
Example.  Expense 1: 6 ducats counter-bribe a modena.

     1) If a unit has a bribe and a counter-bribe the number of the
        counter-bribe ducats is subtracted from the bribe ducats.  If the
        remaining number of bribe ducats are too few to carry out the
        ordered bribe, it fails.
        Example.  If you try to disband a unit with 12+0 ducats and the 
        affected player has counter-bribed it with 3d the disband fails.
        To succeed you would have needed to pay 12+3d.
     2) Counter-bribes are only effective against bribes (expense d-i) and
        cannot be used to counter famine, rebellion or assassination attempts.
     3) Counter-bribes can be ordered for another player's units,
        autonomous garrisons or your own units.
     4) If several bribes are directed at the same unit during the same
        campaign, only the largest one succeeds and all smaller ones fail
        and are wasted.  If there is a tie for the largest bribe, all
        bribes to that unit fail and are wasted.


Expenditures d-i below concerning military units are collectively known as
bribes and may be counter-bribed.

Observe that:
     1) Bribes can be larger than the minimum costs listed in multiples of
        three ducats.  Larger bribes are common to offset suspected counter
        bribes.
     2) The minimum cost for bribes directed at garrisons in major cities
        (those with a number imprinted) are doubled.
     3) Important: A player who orders a bribe to buy another unit may also
        submit orders for that unit in the same campaign.
     4) The size of the bribe must be large enough to carry out the
        specified bribe order.  Even if the amount of the bribe is large
        enough to carry out another, cheaper, bribe, if there are not enough
        ducats for the ordered bribe, it fails.
     5) Citizen's militia a/g/f and elite professional a/g/f costs are
        doubled.  This means that a citizen's militia garrison in Rome would
        cost 12*2*2=48 ducats to disband !!

d) Disband autonomous garrison.
6+3n ducats.  If successful the specified autonomous garrison is removed
from play.
Example.  Expense 1: 9 ducats disband g trent.  (This order would counter
a 3d counter-bribe.)

e) Buy autonomous garrison.
9+3n ducats.  If successful the specified autonomous garrison will become
one of your own garrison units.
Example.  Expense 1: 9 ducats buy g savoy.  (This order would fail if some
other player issued a 3d counter-bribe.)

f) Committed garrison to autonomous.
9+3n ducats.  If successful the specified garrison will become autonomous.
The term "committed" refers to a unit owned by another player as opposed to
"autonomous" which is an unowned unit.
Example.  Expense 1: 9 ducats garrison to autonomous bolog.

g) Disband committed garrison.
12+3n ducats.  If successful the specified garrison is removed from play.
Example.  Expense 1: 12 ducats disband g bari.

h) Disband army or fleet.
12+3n ducats.  If successful the specified unit is removed from play.
Example.  Expense 1: 12 ducats disband a ancon.

i) Buy army or fleet or garrison.
18+3n ducats.  If successful the specified unit becomes one of your own.
An a remains an a, an f remains an f and a g will remain a g.
Example.  Expense 1: 18 ducats buy f marse.


The following expenses - j and k - are not bribes (cannot be counter-bribed)

REBELLIONS
j) Conquered province to rebel.
9 ducats.  This order is given to start a rebellion in an enemy-controlled
province that is not part of said enemy's home country.
Example.  Expense 1: 9 ducats cause rebellion saluz.

k) Home province to rebel.
15 ducats.  This order is given to start a rebellion in an enemy-controlled
province that is part of said enemy's home country.
Example.  Expense 1: 15 ducats cause rebellion tunis.


EFFECTS OF REBELLIONS:
1) See also the section on Venice.
2) Control is *not* affected.
3) Rebellions are always directed against the player controlling the
   province as they can never be placed in a garrisoned city, even if the
   garrison later on leaves or is eliminated.
4) Rebellion units are placed in both the province and, if it's
   ungarrisoned, any fortified city or fortress (if in use) present in the affected
   province.
5) Movement, conversions, retreats and builds
     1) Movement into a rebelling province is not restricted.
     2) The player who the rebellion is directed against can not retreat
        into a rebelling city.
     3) The player who the rebellion is directed against can not convert
        into a rebelling city.
     4) Conversion from garrison to a/f is allowed into a rebelling
        province.  Note that besieged units can not convert.
        (Conversion from a/f to garrison into a rebelling city is only
        possible for a player who the rebellion is *not* directed against
        - the rebellion is liberated.  This situation can never exist as it
        would only be possible if an a/f unit is bought after the rebellion
        has occurred, which in itself would immediately liberate any
        rebellions in the province and city.)
     5) You cannot build new units in rebelling cities or provinces.
     6) You may build a garrison in a non-rebelling city even if the
        containing province is in rebellion.
6) Support
     1) Any player who the rebellion is *not* directed against will get one
        strength point in support when moving into a rebelling province.
     2) Rebels can never give more than one strength point in support even
        if there is a rebellion unit in both the city and the province.
     3) Support from rebels can never be divided between different players
        even if there is a rebellion in both the city and the province.
     4) If more than one player attempts to get the rebel support none gets it.
     5) A converting garrison *not* owned by the affected player will get
        support from the rebellion unit in the province.  (This means that
        a player in a city may cause a rebellion in the province to support
        his own units *into* the province.)  Note that besieged units can
        not convert.
     6) Rebellion units can not and do not support retreats.
7) Income
     1) The controlling player receives no income from rebelling provinces
        or rebelling ungarrisoned cities.
     2) Garrisoned cities produce income (as rebellions can never be placed
        in those).
     3) Income is collected for a city within a rebelling province if the
        city itself is not in rebellion (*even* if the garrison was
        disbanded/removed/eliminated/bought after the rebellion event).
8) How rebellions are removed
   Notice that removal occurs *after* the rebels have given any support.
   Also notice that cities may not be allowed to retreat/convert into, as 
   explained in 5.2-3 above *regardless* of what is said in paragraph 8.3-4.
     1) The player who the rebellion is directed against must besiege a
        rebelling city to "put down" the rebellion.  Any rebellion in the
        province is *also removed* at the completion of the siege.
     2) The player who the rebellion is directed against must "hold" for
        one campaign with an army or fleet to "put down" a rebellion in the
        province (note that a rebelling city must still be besieged).
     3) A player who the rebellion is *not* directed against will
        immediately "liberate" any rebellion upon entering (*including 
        retreats*) a rebelling city or province.  If there is a rebellion 
        in both the city and the province proper *both* rebellions will be 
        liberated.
     4) A player who the rebellion is *not* directed against will
        immediately "liberate" any rebellion if it buys an army or fleet
        or garrison in the rebelling province (if the bought unit was owned
        by the affected player).
     5) Pay for expense B, pacify rebellion. Removes both in city and province.

Note that rebellion affected cities/provinces are noted with a "+" sign in
the results.


ASSASSINATIONS (optional)
L) Assassination.
12, 24 or 36 ducats.  At the start of the game each player is given one
"assassination chit" for each of the other players.  You must have such a
chit to attempt an assassination on another player.  Once an attempt is
made, the corresponding chit is destroyed.  Chits can be traded among the
players (by issuing the 'expense' "give Turkey to Naples).  Such a trade is 
an immediate event that is not reported to the receiver.  Although you will 
get this message: "Turkish assassination chit given to Naples".  You can not change your mind and rescind the order.
When an assassination is executed, a 1d6 die roll is made.  For every 12
ducats paid for the attempt, the chances of being successful increase by
one sixth.  36 is the maximum, giving a 50% possibility for success (3/6).
More then one assassination attempt on the same player may be made in the
same campaign, but the effects are the same whether one or all of them
succeed.
You can check which assassination units you own by listing your game and
look up the assassination info following the player treasury status info.

Example.  Expense 3: 24 ducats assassinate papacy.


EFFECTS OF ASSASSINATION
1) All orders, of the victim, are converted to hold orders although units
   may still be supported by other players' units.  The hold orders cannot
   be used to put down rebellions and all sieges that the player is
   attempting are broken.
2) Expenses are wasted if the bank assassinates you, but go through if you
   are assassinated by another player.
3) Any of the victim's garrisons that are *already under siege* (because
   the enemy began besiegeing in the previous campaign) are immediately 
   eliminated. (To clarify: the G is *not* eliminated if the enemy ordered 
   to begin to besiege in the same campaign as the assassination occurs).  
   If the *besieging unit's player is also assassinated*, the garrison 
   remains.
   (This rule means that the enemy may choose to order the besiegeing unit
   to do something else and still get rid of the garrison ! Note that if
   such an order is given and an assassination fails to happen, the result
   is a wasted season for the unit attempting the siege. The siege remains
   half-way complete.)
4) Some provinces controlled by the victim will rebel.  See under
   rebellions for effects.  Based on a 1d6 die roll:
      Type of province               Die to rebel
      A home province with a unit         1
      Home province with no unit         1-2
      Conquered province with unit       1-3
      Conquered province, no unit        1-5
5) The assassinated player is *not* eliminated from the game.  He
continues, representing his own successor as ruler of the major power.  The
effects of assassination merely show the often chaotic effects of a sudden
shift in power at the top.

(List of allowed expenditures and bribes ends here!)


SELF-BRIBES
Yes you can bribe your own units, although why you would want to do so when  
counter-bribes are cheaper will elude every other player.  In fact all the 
bribes except 'buy' can be used against your own units or provinces.  'Buy' 
cannot be done due to a judge 'feature'; you get e.g. the message:
"Turkey: Garrison Durazzo, No Order Processed".

If you direct a bribe at one of your units at the same time as another player 
tries to bribe the same unit, both will fail as they also would have if two 
enemy powers had tried to bribe your unit.
Naples:  E1: 18d, Buy Turkish fleet Tunis  ** Larger bribe, wasted
Turkey:  E1: 18d, Disband Turkish fleet Tunis  ** Larger bribe, wasted

'Tech note'.  Self-bribes are not allowed according to the Machiavelli or 
Machiavelli 2 rules.  Mach1 rules state that bribes can only be "directed at 
a specific enemy".  Mach2 rules say that they must be directed against 
"enemy controlled" provinces, or against "another player".


SEQUENCE OF PLAY AND ORDER RESOLUTION
Below follows a summary of the sequence of play combined with the adjudicating 
software's order processessing (with the main control adjudications steps).  
Notice that each *step* (a, b etc) is simultaneous, not the whole turn.

   1) Submittal of player orders -- "conflict" phase.
      This is done thrice (one time each in spring, summer and fall)
   1.1) Money and movement
      a) Banking: i.e. loans and loan repayment.
      b) Expenditures not concerning assassinations.
         - control adjudication 1
      c) Expenditures concerning assassinations.
      d) Assassinations of players defaulting on their loans.
      e) Movement order resolution.
         - control adjudication 2
      f) Removal of rebellions in provinces.
         - control adjudication 3
   1.2) If there are retreats results up to this point are mailed to player.
      h) Retreats if any.
         - control adjudication 4
      g) Removal of rebellions in cities.
         - control adjudication 5 (for rebellions and famines)
      h) Removal of famine units (only after spring turn).
      i) Any plague effects (only after spring turn).
         - control adjudication 6
      j) Any storm effects (only after fall turn).
         - control adjudication 7
      k) Any famine effects (only after fall turn).
   1.3) Final results mailed to player.
   2) Submittal of builds and maintenance -- adjustment phase

Notice that in Machiavelli2 there is only one control adjudication step after 
the fall turn (technically the rules say before spring) corresponding to step 
7 in the list above


PROVINCE ABBREVIATIONS
All land spaces can be abbreviated uniquely to their first 5 letters.
Where there are no conflicts, they can also be abbreviated to their first 3
letters.  For conflicting names, the longer of the names can usually be
abbreviated to the first 3 letters and the shorter to some other 3 letter
combination.  Sea spaces can be abbreviated to the first letter of each
word in their name.  There are additional abbreviations which can be

'Tech note'.  In original Machiavelli a unit may be disbanded anytime and
anywhere by writing for example "a mil 0".  That was not allowed in older
nJudge Mach.  But is now supported if you "set disband", see item.

'Tech note'.  For conversions in bi-coastal provinces you need to specify
the coast, else it is not necessary. See also appendix 4.


EXAMPLE OF ORDERS
This example is for movement phase orders of Florence:
Signon Lname <password>
Pay 14 ducats to bank                  All loans from bank must be paid
Pay  6 ducats to Milan                 before giving to another power
Borrow 25 ducats for 2 years           but then more could be borrowed.
       or "Borrow 25 ducats for 2" or "Borrow 25 ducats for two".
Expense 1: 12 ducats Disband Army Bologna
Expense 2:  3 ducats Counter-bribe Army Arezzo
Expense 3: 24 ducats Assassinate Papacy
Army Arezzo -> Sienna
Army Florence -> Arezzo
Fleet Pisa Convert to Garrison
Signoff

If you then changed your mind and decided not to pay the 6 ducats to Milan
or spend the money to counter-bribe Arezzo but instead use it to attempt to
buy the unit in Bologna anticipating a counter-bribe, you could submit a
revision containing:

Signon Lname <password>
Pay 0 ducats to Milan
Ally Naples
Ally Turkey
Expense 1: 21 ducats buy Army Bologna
Expense 2: none
Army Bologna -> Ferrara
Signoff

Notice that your ordering of Bologna will be ignored if you decide not to 
buy the unit, even if the order may continue to be shown in the replies.


ORDER SHORTHAND
Some bribes/expenses need not be spelled out, but have abbreviated forms.
Expense 1: buy fer = 18 ducats buy [a|f|g] fer.
Expense 1: disband dur = 12 ducats disband [a|f|g] dur.
Notice that the judge only chooses 'g' if there is no 'a' or 'f' present in 
the province.
If you instead qualify the unit 'disband g dur' the statement would default 
to '12 ducats disband g dur'.

Then there are some oddities due to the parsing of text and math handling 
that give e.g. these results:
Expense 1: +3 ducats... = "6 ducats..."
Expense 1: +6 ducats... = "12 ducats..."
Expense 1: 6+3 ducats... = "9 ducats..."


ORDER ODDITIES
The judge behaves a bit unexpectedly when you building and disband new 
units.  If you e.g. order B G|A|F BAR and then change your mind and issue 
R|D G|A|F BAR you'll get the error message: 
   N: b g bar
   Cannot debuild and build in Bari.
To successfully remove the unwanted build you must first send a maintain 
order, M G|A|F BAR, and then, after getting the judge reply, send the 
remove/disband order.


VARIANT SPECIFIC JUDGE COMMANDS FOR GAME OPTIONS
The "set" command can be used by the moderator/master of a game to enable
or disable the following options:

set [no]mach2
To use or not the Machiavelli 2nd edition (1995) rules.  Always disabled 
by default.

set [no]summer
To ignore the summer turn (and plague).  Allows diplomacy-style 2 season 
years.  Always disabled by default.

set [no]money
If you set nomoney cities are treated as supply centers and builds are 
calculated as per normal Diplomacy rules even in Machiavelli1 !  You 
cannot bribe, assassinate, use special units or get any income.
To fully enable the Machiavelli Basic rules you also need to set nodice. 

set [no]dice
To disable/enable random events.  Setting nodice automatically disables
famine, plague, loans and assassinations.  Enabling any of the said options
automatically enables the dice option.  Selected rolls for variable income
will always be a 4 in odd years and a 3 in even years.
To fully enable the Machiavelli Basic rules you also need to set nomoney. 

set [no]loans  or  set [no]bank[ers]
To disable/enable the borrowing of ducats from the bank.  This does not
affect whether one player can give money to another player.

set [no]famine
To disable/enable the famine rules.

'Tech note': Perugia never has famine as it is not incl. in the table.

set [no]plague
To disable/enable the plague rules.  Always disabled by default.

'Tech note': Arezzo, Piombino, Pistoia and Ragusa never have plague as
they are not incl. in the table.  They are incl.in the 1995 2nd ed.

set [no]storm
To disable/enable the fall sea storms that can sink fleets.  Always 
disabled by default.

set [no]assassinations
To disable/enable the use of the assassination *expenditure*.  Regardless
of this setting you will still be assassinated by the *bankers* if you do
not repay your loans.

set [no]garrisons
To disable/enable the garrison unit types.  You may not use, build or 
convert to these.  Any garrison setup info will be ignored.  
Always disabled by default.

set [no]special
To disable/enable the special unit types.

set [no]fortresses | [no]forts
To allow or not the use of additional fortified cities.  Always disabled 
by default.

set [no]adjacency
To disable/enable the restriction that bribes can only be directed to units
to which you have an adjacent unit.  See table below.
A city (regardless of type) is always adjacent to its containing province
and any province bordering the containing province.
A province (regardless if sea or land) is always adjacent to any bordering
province and any cities in the bordering provinces.
This means that a fleet in, say, Sienna is considered adjacent to a
garrison in Florence for the purposes of bribery.  You can always counter-
bribe your own unit as it will suffice as its own adjacent unit.

Unit adjacency requirements for bribes and assassinations.
Action               Adjacency enabled               Adjacency disabled
Famine relief (a)    required (to prov or city)      not required
Pacify reb (b)       required (to prov or city)      not required
Counter bribe (c)    required (to army or fleet)     not required
Bribes d-i           required (to army or fleet)     not required
Cause reb. (j,k)     required (to prov or city)      not required
Assassination (l)    not required                    not required

set [no]coastal convoys
To disallow/allow use of fleets in coastal provinces in convoys. Coastal
convoys are by default enabled for the standard Machiavelli variant.

set [no]disband
To disable/enable the Mach1 disband rule. That allows you to disband
units anytime.  E.g. a sav disband.  Always enabled for Mach1.

The status of these options are listed in the "full" listing of the games
under the heading "flags".  The default settings for the various Mach
variants are (missing flags cannot be set/used):
     1) Mach1: famine, noplague, loans, assassinations, dice, special,
        noforts, adjacency, nostorm, money, coastalconvoy, nodisband
     2) Mach2: famine, noplague, loans, assassinations, dice, special,
        noforts, adjacency, nostorm, money, nocoastalconvoy, nodisband
     3) Basic mach: nofamine, noplague, noloans, noassassinations, nodice,
        nospecial, noforts, noadjacency, nostorm, nomoney, coastalconvoy, 
        disband.


APPENDIX 1.  EXPLANATION OF THE MAP FILE.
This section is *not* part of the rules.  It is only intended as a player
aid for those interested in creating their own judge scenarios or just
interested in the hard data for provinces.

The file map.machiavelli contains information that is used when the judge
parses the results.  The first half of the file describes the provinces and
the second half possible moves and convoys.  At the end are the famine,
plague and variable income tables and summary province ordering.

Province characteristics are described thus:
full name   terrain|ownership   city income   city type   abbreviations.
Terrain types are neutral SC/city (x), land (l), water (w) (in some non-
mach variants also ice (v) and convoyable coastal space (c)).  Ownership
*at game start* is noted with the unique power initial.  City income is
zero to (currently) three.  City  types are fortified port (P),
unfortified port (p), fortified city (f), unfortified city (.).
The combination of zero income followed by a city type identifier indicates
the presence of a fortress.  Zero followed by dot (0.) indicates no city.
Water is hardcoded to give 1 ducat income.  Venice's characteristics are
set by an additional V following all other flags (see below).

Examples.
Albania,       T1.  alb alban  =  Turkish home city, 1d, unfortified.
Ancona,        P1P  anc ancon  =  Papal home city, 1d, fortif. port.
Aquila,        N0f  aqu aquil  =  Neapolitan home prov., no city, fortr.
Bay of Tunis,  w0.  bot        =  water prov., 0d, no city.
Venice,        V3PV ven venic  =  Venetian home, 3d, fortif. port,
                                     "venice" rules apply

Notice that to count a neutral province you must define it as 'x'. If you 
identify it with 'l' it will generate zero ducat income and ownership will 
be ignored and not reported.

Adjacency and 'convoyability' information is described thus:
province-adjacency type   adjacent provinces/sea areas.
The types of adjacencies are: adjacencies for armies (mv), adjacencies for
fleets/convoys (xc if one coast; nc, sc, ec, wc if divided coasts; cc for
canals/straits that can be blocked in mach) (in some non-mach variants
there is also adjacency for armies moving with one less support, mx).

Examples.
alb-mv: rag her dur            and for fleets   alb-xc: rag las dur
cro-nc: crn ist aus   and for the south coast   cro-sc: dal ist
ets-xc: psa/cc pio sie pat tiv gon mes pal wts
ets-cc: psa

For more information see the file njudgemapdatahowto.htm.


APPENDIX 2 -- MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OLDER VERSIONS OF MACH

Differences between AH 1980 and 1983 (the first 2nd edition) editions.
1)  No money lenders -- no bank (this must surely be a misprint in my
    rules)
2)  Necessary to control both city and province to gain the additional
    "city/province" variable income roll.
3)  Balance of Power scenario.  Papal home country includes Tivoli.
    Control of Naples or Milan city and province awards 1d6 variable
    income roll.
4)  Struggle for Dominance I scenario.  Control of Genoa or Florence city
    and province awards 1d6 variable income roll.


APPENDIX 3 -- HOW TO PLAY DIPLOMACY WITH A MACHIAVELLI MAP OR HOW TO 
              DISABLE MACHIAVELLI FEATURES AS TO BE ABLE TO PLAY
              STANDARD DIPLOMACY

To play on the standard map choose the variant "dipmach".

To be able to play as 3-season Diplomacy you must set up the game thus:
     create ?gamename yourpassword variantname
     set mach2     (this flag enables the "diplomacy build rules")
     set nodice    (this removes disasters, variable income and more)
     set nomoney   (this removes all use of money)
     set nospecial (this removes the use of elite and militia units)
     set nostorm

What are the differences with Diplomacy if I play "3-season mach w garr" ?
Just these few:
     1) you can garrison* an A or F by ordering e.g. A LON C G or 
        F LON C G (fleets only in provinces with an anchor symbol).
     2) you can convert* an A to an F by e.g. ordering in spring 
        A LON C G and in summer G LON C F.
     3) a garrisoned unit may be eliminated by siege by e.g. ordering 
        A LON B G for two *consecutive seasons*
        (you do not have to write A LON B G LON as an army can only 
        besiege a G in the province that the army is present in).
     4) there is also a summer season

*Only some SC's (cities) may be garrisoned, these are indicated by square 
SC symbols. (The number in some cities is for Mach play only and can be 
ignored in this case.)

To play 100% Standard Diplomacy also set these flags
     set nogarrisons (this removes the use of garrisons)
     set nosummer (this removes the summer moves and plagues)
     set nocoastalconvoys
     set nodisband

What are the differences with Diplomacy if I play "2-season mach w/o garr" ?
None !!!


APPENDIX 4 -- RULES FOR MULTI-COASTAL PROVINCES

How conversions are to be resolved in multi-coastal areas containing a city (e.g.
St. Petersburg).

Current status: all coasts are available for conversion or builds regardless 
of placement of city or anchor symbol.

Probable future rule (used at GM's discretion):

Version 1: Fleets may only be built or convert to garrison or vice versa from/to 
a sea area containing the anchor symbol.  Would both coasts have the anchor then 
both coasts would be eligible for conversion.

Version 2: Fleets may only be built or convert to garrison or vice versa from/to 
a sea area containing the anchor symbol.  Only *one anchored* coast may exist.

Support from fleets into multi-coastal provinces:
As in Diplomacy support is only successful if the fleet giving support can 
move to the coast that the supported fleet is on.

Ordering: e.g. G STP C F /NC and F STP/NC C G

   (1) Plague and storms have no direct effcet, although the loss of 
       the unit obviously affects income indirectly.
   (2) Fortressess only generate income if in use.
   (3) n/a = not applicable


APPENDIX 6 -- HOW DO I KNOW WHAT RULE SET THE GAME I JOINED USES
Look at the game settings in the listing. If you have a line saying 
'Mach2:' the game is run with the nJudge Machiavelli 2nd edition rules. 
But if it says 'Mach:' the game runs with the nJudge Classic rules.
