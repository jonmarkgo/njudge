Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                  3 February, 2003
Draws.

Automated drawing is facilitated with two commands: SET [NO]DIAS and SET [NO]DRAW.

The term "DIAS" means "Draws Include All Survivors". In a game designated
as DIAS, a surviving player cannot be excluded from a draw. In a NoDIAS
game, a surviving player may give up his right to be included in a draw.
In either case, unanimous approval of surviving players is required for
a draw to be passed.

By default, all games are DIAS. The moderator can change this with the
SET NODIAS or SET DIAS commands.

In a DIAS game, a player may cast his vote for a draw by issuing the command
SET DRAW. He may veto earlier approval by issuing the command SET NODRAW.
If at any time all surviving players accede to a DIAS draw, the game will
be immediately terminated, and all participants in the game will be
informed of the result.

The situation for NoDIAS games is a bit more complex. To vote for a NoDIAS
draw, a player issues the command SET DRAW [drawlist], where [drawlist]
is a list of the identifiers for the powers he wishes included in the
draw. When a player gives approval to [drawlist] and [drawlist] includes
his own power, he is also implicitly approving any subset of [drawlist]
that also includes his power. On the other hand, when a player gives
approval to [drawlist] and [drawlist] does *not* include his own power, he
is implicitly approving any subset of [drawlist], *and* any subset of
[drawlist] including his own power.

For example, if Austria issued the command SET DRAW AEG, he is approving the
draws AEG, AG, AE, or A. Note that by including himself in his draw list,
he is assuring that he cannot be excluded from a draw. If Austria issued
the command SET DRAW FT, he is approving FT, F, T, AFT, AF, AT, or A.

If, under these rules, more than one draw is approved by all players, the
draw including the most players passes.

In a NoDIAS game, SET NODRAW is equivalent to the command SET DRAW x, where
x is the power issuing the command. This means that the player will only
accept a concession to himself.

Here are a few examples of the draw mechanism in action. The players listed
are assumed to be the only survivors.

    France: SET DRAW AEF
    England: SET DRAW AEF
    Austria: SET DRAW AEF
    Results in a three-way draw between Austria, England, and France.

    France: SET DRAW AE
    England: SET DRAW AEF
    Austria: SET DRAW AEF
    Results in a three-way draw between Austria, England, and France.

    France: SET DRAW AE
    England: SET DRAW AEF
    Austria: SET DRAW AE
    Results in a two-way draw between Austria and England.

    France: SET DRAW AEF
    England: SET DRAW AE
    Austria: SET DRAW AE
    This game does not end in a draw.

    France: SET DRAW A
    England: SET DRAW A
    Austria: SET NODRAW
    Results in a concession to Austria.

Any draw vote, DIAS or NoDIAS, is good for one phase only. All draw votes
are cleared at the end of a phase. A drawn game may be restarted with the
RESUME command.
