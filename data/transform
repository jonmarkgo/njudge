Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                  3 February, 2003
transform

Several options are provided allowing players to transform units under
restricted circumstances, allowing an ill-chosen fleet to be replaced by
an army, etc. These options must be activated before the game starts by
means of the SET TRANSFORM command.  They cannot be changed after the start.
In a moderated game, this command is only available to the Moderator.

The syntax for this command is as follows:

SET TRANSFORM NONE

    Disable all transform orders (equivalent to SET NOTRANSFORM).

SET TRANSFORM <when>:<where> [<when>:<where>]

    <when> is either MOVE or BUILD

    <where> is one of:
        HOME[CENTRE]
        ONE[CENTRE]
        ANY[CENTRE]
        ANYWHERE
        NONE

"CENTRE" and "CENTER" are interchangeable (and optional).  Note that "ANY" is
assumed to be an abbreviation for "ANYCENTRE", so "ANYWHERE" must be spelled out
in full if used.

Warnings:

   If you omit the "when" specification, it defaults to BUILD.  So,
   "SET TRANSFORM :ANYCENTRE" is the same as "SET TRANSFORM BUILD:ANYCENTRE".

   If you omit the "where" specification, it defaults to HOME CENTRE.  So,
   "SET TRANSFORM MOVE" is equivalent to "SET TRANSFORM MOVE:HOMECENTRE".

   SET TRANSFORM <where> without a ":" will return an error message.

   SET TRANSFORM NONE and SET NOTRANSFORM do not work correctly in njudge
   versions 1.3.1 and earlier.  Once transform options are turned on in these
   versions, there is no way to turn them off (except by manual editing of
   the game file by the Judgekeeper)!

If activated, the transform options operate as follows:

"When" options
--------------

MOVE:  Allows transformations in a move phase where permitted by the "where"
       specification.

Any unit ordered to transform that is dislodged has the transformation
automatically cancelled. As a transform move works like a hold move, it can
however be given support and, if not dislodged, will work. You do not support
a transformation, merely support said unit to hold.  If a unit is attacked
but not dislodged, the result depends on the status of the AttackTransform
flag, which is set (before the game begins) as follows:

    SET ATTACKTRANSFORM
        A unit that is attacked, but not dislodged, while ordered to
        transform will succeed.  (Default.)

    SET NOATTACKTRANSFORM
        A unit that is attacked, but not dislodged, while ordered to
        transform will fail.

BUILD:  Allows transformations in a build phase where permitted by the
        "where" specification.

As any player can transform a unit in a build phase, unless no buildable
centres are occupied by a unit of theirs, an automatic 'wait' is placed on
the build phase.

"Where" options:
----------------

HOME CENTRE:  Transformations are allowed during the specified phase only for
              units on a player's home centres.

ONE CENTRE:   Transformations are allowed during the specified phase in any
              centre as long as the player owns at least one home centre.

ANY CENTRE:   Transformations are allowed during the specified phase in any
              centre.

ANYWHERE:     Transformations are allowed during the specified phase in any
              land province (units can never transform at sea).  However, wings
              that are blockading may not transform during a build phase.

NONE:         No transformations are allowed during the specified phase.


Once activated, players can order transforms using the following syntax:

for moves:
[<unit>] <location> TRANSFORMS TO <unit> [<coast>]

for build phases:
TRANSFORM [<unit>] <location> [<coast>] TO <unit>

The abbreviation 'TRAFO' can be used for both of these forms, but otherwise
cannot be further shortened (to avoid confusion with the 'transport'
abbreviations already in existence).  The type of unit to be transformed into
must be specified (because this option can be used in games with Wing units).
