Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                   June 25, 2000
Info.A-F

This variant qualifier is for supporting Army/Fleet rules, used 
especially in Abstract variation (whereby an army and a fleet can
combine into a joint Army/Fleet unit).

The judge implementation for this is incomplete, and is not supported
at present.
