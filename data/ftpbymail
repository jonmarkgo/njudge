Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                   June 6, 1994.

Many files are available at different sites on the Internet via a
mechanism called FTP (for File Transfer Protocol).  If your system is
directly connected to the Internet, you can use the local ftp command
directly.  If you are not directly connected to the Internet, you can
still access files via FTP by Email.  If you are not sure if you are
connected to the Internet for FTP, ask your local system
administrators.

At the time of this writing, there are two addresses which provide FTP
by Email access:

        ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
        ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu

FTP commands should be placed in the body of your message similar to
sending commands to the Judge.

To get a list of commands available, send the command "help" to one of
the addresses above.  Some commands that you might want to use are:

        connect <site name, such as nda.com>
        chdir   <directory files you want are in; only one per session>
        dir     <return a listing of the current directory's files>
        get     <name of file you want sent to you>

For example, to get a directory listing of the Diplomacy archive on
nda.com, you would send the following commands:

        connect nda.com
        chdir /pub/diplomacy
        dir

To get a PostScript map of the standard variant, you would send the
following commands:

        connect nda.com
        chdir /pub/diplomacy/Maps
        get standard.ps

You can get more than one file with multiple get commands.

After a while you should get a mail response similar to this:

    From: "ftpmail service on ftp-gw-1.pa.dec.com" <nobody@pa.dec.com>
    To: starkey@netcom.com
    Subject: your ftpmail request has been received

    We processed the following input from your mail message:

         <what commands you sent>

    We have entered the following request into our job queue
    as job number 749867482.01937:

The message will conclude with how many jobs are ahead of yours.
Since this service is in such high demand, expect to wait 24 hours or
more for your files.
