Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!             20th Februrary 2001
Absence.

An attempt to remove the greatest burden from moderators: that of 
administrating holiday requests.

Now players (and the moderator too) can indicate periods when they will
not be available and when the game should extend its deadlines automatically.

The concerned player commands are:

  SET ABSENCE start_date [TO end_date]
    Requests an absence between the date specified (or the single day if no
    end date is given. Neither start_date nor end_date can be before the
    current date. If end_date is before the current deadline, it will be
    effectively ignored. If absences are overlaid, they count as separate
    absences. 
    

  SET NOABSENCE start_date [TO end_date]
    Cancel a requested absence period. The period cancelled is one which 
    includes the specified start_date. The end_date is ignored. The first
    absence found which includes the specified date is the one cancelled.

Only a maximum of 3 (three) absences can be requested per player. Masters too
can request absences (with this same limit) but observers cannot.
Each requested absence will generate an informative message to the master when
requested, and he will also see the pending future absences every time he sends 
a message for the game (as per moves). 

If an absence request exceeds the game limit, a message will be sent to the master
who must manually activate the absence for it to take effect. (One technique 
is to use the 'become' command and set the absence for the player.)

When it is time for the next turn deadline to be calculated, the deadline is 
increased for each absence requested when at least one of the following 
conditions is met:
 - Master requested the absence
 - Player has a move to make and game is either StrictWait or NoPress
 - Game has press and is not StrictWait
 - The game is set to 'quiet' mode.

All absences which become out of date (due to a previous absence activating,
master manually advancing the deadline or deadline automatically exceeding
the absence) will be deleted when the next turn is processed.

Note: The deadline will be ajusted to be equal to the last end date requested.
So, if want some time after your return to consider your move, addd a little
bit accordingly.
