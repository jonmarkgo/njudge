Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                  July 20, 1991.
master

To become a master for a particular game, you must be signed on as the only
player and then use the "become master" command.  Thus to create a new
Youngstown variant game called "older" with yourself as master send the
following text to the judge:

   create ?older <password> youngstown
   become master

If anyone else is signed on to the game you will not be allowed to become
master.  If you wish to relinquish your master slot to another person the
best way is to just give him your password and then he can submit a request
containing:

   signon molder <oldpassword>
   set password <newpassword>
   set address

If you wish to become the master for an existing game that has other players
and/or observers signed on or if you would like to become a secondary master
you should contact the administrator of the adjudicator.

To set up a "private" game you can use the "set nolist" command immediately
after creating the game:

   create ?older <password> youngstown
   set nolist
   become master

The nolist setting will prevent any announcements about the game to be
distributed to anyone not signed onto the game.  People can still use the
"list older" command to get a status of the game, but a "list" command
that lists all current games will not display this game.  People cannot
find out about the game unless they've been told.  This is useful for
games that you want to set up as "by invitation only".  Once the invited
players have signed on and powers have been assigned you can use the "set
list" command to allow other people to begin seeing the game.  Note that
you don't have to be the master in such a game, it could be unmoderated
with you as a player if you wish.  The point demonstrated here is that
the "set nolist" must appear before the "become master" or before another
player signs on since either of those actions would generate an
announcement on a "listed" game.

Once you have become the master for a game you can sign on to your game using
the "m<name>" syntax and use the following commands:

   become <power>
     This allows you to submit orders for a particular power if, for
     example, the player for that power gets disconnected from the network
     and calls you on the phone to give you orders.  Note that when you
     use the become command the password for the power is written to the
     reply file and the reply file is sent back to both you and the true
     owner of the power.  For this reason (and other implementation
     details) you can only use one become command per mail message.
     CAVEAT: If you forget about this and try to do something like:

        become russia              \
        army rum support bul-ser    \
        army sev-ukr                 \
                                      \  *** DON'T DO THIS! ***
        become turkey                 /
        army bul-rum                 /
        fleet bla support bul-rum   /
        army arm-sev               /

     the Russian player will see the orders you're trying to submit for
     Turkey (since they'll be displayed followed by "The unit in xxxx is 
     not owned by Russia") and he might possibly get wise to a stab.

     Actually, all commands following a "become" command submitted by a
     nonmaster will be ignored to prevent the above potential disaster.

     The become command is not really necessary to submit a power's orders.
     Orders for units belonging to one or more powers can be submitted as
     the master, but the true owner of the power will not receive the
     confirmation reply from the judge.  Orders for multiple units can
     be specified on the same line, but you shouldn't mix orders for units
     belonging to multiple powers on the same line.  Also note that the
     "orders have been received" flag will NOT get set for a particular
     power if their orders were submitted by the master without the become
     command.  It this case, it may be necessary to use the process command
     to get the phase processed.


   process [phase]
     This forces the judge to process orders immediately with whatever
     it has in its list.  Partial or nonexistant orders do not cause 
     powers to be considered in civil disorder.  This can be useful
     after a rollback command or if you want to not wait for a player
     for some particular reason.  If the optional phase is specified,
     the process command will be ignored unless that is indeed the
     current phase.  Specifying the phase allows you to avoid potential
     disaster if the judge processed the phase shortly ahead of getting
     your request.  Without it, your command would process the subsequent
     phase which could potentially expose orders that players had pending.
     A typical phase specificiation might be "fall 1905 retreat".


   rollback turn
     This allows you to roll the game back to the specified turn number.
     The turn number is displayed in all the reports and lists, starting
     at 001 for spring movement of 1901 and incrementing for each actual
     phase that's played.  Retreats and adjustments that are not played do
     not increment the turn number.  History is kept for at least a month,
     but it may not be possible to go back too far -- this command is
     intended to go back one phase for the case where one person's orders
     get messed up and need to be resubmitted.  Orders for intermediate
     turns that were skipped over should remain intact, but if the change
     in processing causes a retreat phase to [not] be required the previous
     orders may wind up being meaningless.  Any pending orders that existed
     will also be reprocessed so if they were revised by hand the first time
     the replayed phase was processed the revisions may get lost.

   set [un]moderated
     This command sets or clears the flag that disallows the other players
     from adjusting the deadlines and other parameters associated with the
     game.  By default the moderated flag will be enabled when the you
     first become master.  Clearing the flag with "set unmoderated" will
     allow the players to control the game while still giving you the
     ability to use the other commands accessible only to the master.

   set [no]proxy
     This command sets or clears the flag that allows one player to give
     control of one or more of his units to another player.

   set comment text
     This command sets or clears the text that appears in the brief listing
     format.  The text consists of the remainder of the line.  A null text
     field will clear the brief comment.  The brief comment should be less
     than 60 characters.

   set comment begin
     If the text of the comment is the keyword "begin" the remainder of 
     the mail message up to a signoff command will be used for the full 
     comment.  Placing a signoff command directly after the "set comment 
     begin" command will clear the full comment.

   set all press
     This command sets the flag that will cause all partial press between
     the players to be copied (silently) to you as well.  This is useful
     in a gunboat game to see what devious plans the players are preparing.
     It is not too useful in non-gunboat games as players may communicate
     directly rather than going through the judge so you may miss traffic.
     Note, if you use this option you must pay careful attention so that
     you don't leak any information to the other players.

   set normal press
     This command clears the "all press" flag.

See the file "index" for a complete list of the rest of the flags that
you can set or clear as the master.

The reply that you get back from the judge after signing on as master
(unless you relinquish the master status by using the become command)
will include the [partial] orders that the players have submitted.  It
is assumed that if you are taking the role of master that you will not
leak this information to the wrong people.

As a special note about finding replacement players, the proper way to
get a new player signed on is to allow him to submit the signon himself
for an abandoned power.  You can use the become command to resign the
old player, but if you use "set address" and "set password" the judge 
won't properly update the internal tables that indicate who is playing
that power.  The dedication ratings and site access info may not reflect
what is really happening if the player doesn't go through the taking
over of the power himself.  It is possible to submit mail to the judge
and make it look like it came from the player, however.  The judge only
pays attention to the last "Reply-To: " line that it finds in the mail,
or if there isn't a Reply-To, then to the last "From: " that it finds.
Thus you can submit a message to the judge that looks like:

    Reply-To: user@host.domain.org
    signon xname password

to ensure that that player gets signed on properly.  You won't, however,
get a reply from the judge (it will go to the player) so you're really
operating blind if you do this.  It is preferred to have the player do
the signon himself.

For further information, see the files "ep.house.rules" and "how2gm"
which are available via mail to the judge.
