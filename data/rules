Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                   May 19, 1990.
Rules.

Avalon Hill has not given me permission to distribute copies of the
rules.  To get a set of rules contact:

    The Avalon Hill Game Company
    4517 Harford Road
    Baltimore, Maryland   21414

    1-800-999-3222  or  (301) 254-9200


The adjudicator follows The Rules of Diplomacy as specified by The Avalon
Hill Company with the following exceptions:

VII.3.b: When a fleet can move to two coasts and the coast is not specified,
         the adjudicator will pick an arbitrary coast.  Actually not totally
         arbitrary, but the first one in its movement list.

VII.7:   Abbreviations are the first three characters of the province name
         except for provinces starting with 'gul', 'liv', 'nor' and 'tyr'.  
         These are abbreviated as follows:

           gob: Gulf of Bothnia
           gol: Gulf of Lyon
           lvp: Liverpool
           lvn: Livonia
           naf: North Africa
           nat: North Atlantic Ocean
           nrg: Norwegian Sea
           nth: North Sea
           nwy: Norway
           tyr: Tyrolia
           tys: Tyrrhenian Sea

         Other reasonable abbreviations are also defined.  For a complete
         list see the file available with the 'get map' command.

IX.1:    Do not specify owners of units in support and convoy orders.  This
         redundant specification would unnecessarily complicate the parser.
         The movement results will indicate the alternate power on support
         and convoy orders.

IX.7:    Based on the second statement after XIV.5, IX.7 does not apply if
         either or both of the dislodged or dislodging unit is convoyed.

XII:     Armies intending to use a convoy must specify the convoy route in
         their movement orders as in the examples: 

               A LON-ENG-BEL, 
               F ENG C A LON-BEL.

         or    A LON-ENG-MID-WES-TUN, 
               F ENG C A LON-TUN, 
               F MID C A LON-TUN,
               F WES C A LON-TUN,
               A NAF S A LON-TUN.

XII.4:   Since convoy routes must be specified, there will never be any
         ambiguity.

XII.5:   This rule when taken literally can have some unintended results.
         For example:

         England: F Iri-Mid, F Eng S F Iri-Mid
         France:  F Spa(nc) S F Mid, F Mid Convoy A Por-Bre, A Por-Mid-Bre
         Italy:   F Gulf of Lyon Convoy A Tus-Spa, A Tus-GoL-Spa
 
         What happens in the Mid-Atlantic ocean?  What about if the 
         additional order:
 
         Italy:   A Mar S A Tus-Spa
 
         is entered?  With literal interpretation of the rules, the fleet
         in Spain would be dislodged, but its support to the fleet in the
         Mid-Atlantic Ocean (of an action in a body of water containing a
         convoying fleet) would not be cut.  This adjudicator makes five
         passes to determine what support gets cut:

         1) Normal non-convoyed movement cuts support.
         2) Any armies being convoyed by fleets that would be dislodged
            without further support cuts are flagged "maybe no convoy".
         3) Any convoyed armies without the "maybe no convoy" status cut
            support provided by units in their destination provinces.
         4) Any armies being convoyed by fleets that still would be 
            dislodged are flagged "definitely no convoy".
         5) Any armies still flagged "maybe no convoy" status cut support
            of units in their destination provinces.  The "maybe no convoy"
            status is cleared.

         Using this algorithm, Spain's support above would be cut in pass
         three.  The Mid-Atlantic Ocean's dislodgement would be detected
         in pass four.  Portugal would be given the "no convoy" status and
         thus would have no effect on any unit in Brest in pass five.

XIV.4:   If a power is required to remove a unit and no valid order is
         received, the least recently produced unit that is not at a supply
         center will be disbanded.  This is the first one listed on the 
         reports which will be the one most likely to be furthest away from 
         a home supply center.
