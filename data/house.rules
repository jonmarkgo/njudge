Generic Judge House Rules		13th January 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes the Generic Judge House Rules. These House Rules
apply to any game running on any judge.

These House Rules may be modifiedby any rules specific to the judge being 
used. They can also be modified by the rules of the particular variant
being played and/or specifically by the GM. GMs should announce such
differences at the time of the game creation.

This document supplements Avalon Hill's Diplomacy rules (most recent
American edition.)

General rules:

1) Joining a game implies an intention to play the game through to the end.
Leaving a game without a good reason is considered very disrespectful. Don't
join unless you are willing to commit yourself to an entire game, which
may take several months or more.

2) Automatic allies or automatic enemies will not be allowed in the same game.
If you violate this rule you risk, at the very least, expulsion from the game.

3) Players may not communicate with each other directly (ie, through
a mechanism other than the judge) in games where the identity of other
players is concealed, or at all in games where communication is
barred. The potential for this arises if they guess at another
player's identity or if the player's identity is accidentally
revealed.

3a) Players in gunboat games may not make any claim, true or false,
as to their real identities.

4) Players are expected to treat each other with dignity and respect. Abusive
language or behavior is frowned on, unless clearly in character in a
roleplayed game. Players should also treat the GM and JK in a civil manner.

5) Unless otherwise stated, observers should not offer opinions and
analysis of the game.

6) Players should submit moves by the deadline. It is suggested that players
submit a set of tentative orders as soon as possible and then modify them as
the turn progresses.  A player who consistently submits moves after the
deadline risks being expelled from the game.

7) Players should not continue negotiations past the deadline. If they need
more time they should request a deadline extension. If you have already
submitted orders, you may continue to diplome after the deadline has
passed.

8) It is unacceptable behavior to deliberately submit moves late for any reason
(example, while awaiting reply from an ally).

9) Turns will never be replayed. THe previous turn may be reprocessed if required
to correct an error, but no new orders will be allowed. Turns will only be
so reprocessed if there was an error in calculating the results on the part of the
judge software. If an error occurs which, to be fixed, requires new orders, that
error will stand and the game will continue. The GM may alter orders as required
to acheive the correct result (for example, changing to a hold order).
[For example, if a unit is incorrectly marked as dislodged, in a turn, that turn
 can be replayed as long as no further turns have been processed that involve 
 other units orders.
 However, if, for example, an extra unit is discovered several turns later, that
 unit will stay and the correction made at the next adjustment phase.]

10) If a player is unable to continue playing, the player should
notify the GM as soon as possible to allow the GM time to find a
replacement.

11) Computer opponents are not allowed in games without prior permission.

12) A valid registration form is required for all players. Lying on your
registration for is grounds for expulsion from the judge. The following
fields must be valid: 
    Name, Email, Level, Address (city and state only), Country.

13) A player is responsible for submitting their own orders. In case of
difficulty, orders can be emailed directly to the GM but the final
responsibility lies with the player.

Player Guidlines

1) Players should direct all questions and comments to the
GM, not the JK, unless one of the situations described in
the next two rules applies.

2) If a GM seems to have disappeared, players should contact
the JK immediately so that he can resolve the situation.

3) If the GM is suspected of cheating, players should
contact the JK immediately so that he can investigate the
allegation

4) Players will review their registration every time they
sign onto a new game to ensure that it is complete, up to
date and accurate.

5) Before reregistering on a judge, players will read the
appropriate instructions to insure that their current
registration is updated, and that they don't end up with a
second registration. 

Player Replacement:

1) Players may not reenter a game as a different power under any
conditions. 
Note that if this is specifically over-ruled for a game, that 
game will invalid for rating purposes and must be stated by the GM
and approved by all players, if the game is in progress.

GM rules:

1) All games must have a GM.

2) GMs are to remain scrupulously impartial in all matters.

3) GMs should not change the parameters of the game after players
start signing up for the game unless the players unanimously vote to
do so.  This includes changing the deadline calculation, victory
conditions, press flags, etc.

4) GMs may not play in their own game. Judge keepers may not play in
any game on their own judge.

GM Guidlines:

1) The GM will answer any questions about rule mechanics,
adjudication or judge commands and operation that players
may have, to the best of his ability.

2) The GM will not advise players as to what strategy or
tactics to follow.

3) The GM will follow the game and take steps necessary to
ensure its smooth operation. (This includes granting
extensions, as necessary; resolving disputes that have
become personal; and insuring that the game is not tainted
by cheating.

4) The GM will review the registrations of the players to
make sure they are complete and appear to be up to date and
accurate. He will also look for signs of players that may be
cheating or who may know each other personally.

5) The GM will notify the JK immediately if he suspects
there may be cheating in his game.

6) The GM may refuse to allow anyone to join the game, if
that player does not meet the criteria (newbie, minimum
dedication, etc.) or the GM feels that that player may be a
detriment to the game. In the latter case, care should be
taken to ensure that players are not excluded without good
cause.

7) The GM may contact the JK for advice whenever he feels
necessary.

8) The GM need not contact the JK for permission to run a
game on their judge, unless the judge's specific house rules
specifically say so, or the game will require some sort of
special attention by the JK to operate properly.

9) The GM will only create games that he intends to GM to
completion. Once created, the GM will continue to GM a game
until it is finished. If a GM cannot fulfill this
requirement, he will notify the JK immediately.


Voting:.

1) All votes to change the nature of the game (deadline calculation,
et al) must be unanimous. Settings that do not change the character of the
game (such as deadline calculation etc.) require unanimity of all surviving
players: any other changes require all players to agree. 
The game will never under any circumstances be changed to non-DIAS once 
started.

2) The GM is responsible for officially announcing a vote and recording the
outcome. He must announce the outcome of the vote but should not announce
the number of votes for each option or how anyone voted.

3) A vote is not closed until the next move has processed.

4) In all cases, if a player does not submit a vote, then that player
is assumed to have voted against the proposal, ie NVR=no.

5) GMs may be ejected by a unanimous vote of the players. The vote will be
run by the judge keeper. This is really a method of last resort and the
judge keeper will only allow this after all other methods have failed.

Draws:

1) A win is defined as a draw including only one player. 

2) Draw votes will be managed by the judge where available. If the draw
mechanism is unavailable, the GM will run the vote. The draws will be
DIAS unless otherwise stated when the game was created or unless the
game was changed to non-DIAS by the players prior to the game starting.
Games will not be changed to non-DIAS status under any circumstances 
once started.

3) Voting on draws is anonymous.  Draws may only include players that
have not been eliminated from the game.  Draws may not give order of
finishes such as 2nd place, 3rd place, etc.  Players are either
included in the draw or not.

4) The following people can vote in a draw: All players who have units may vote.
Only players who can vote can be included in the draw.

5) All players entitled to vote must vote unanimously for the draw
vote for it to pass.

(Note that the judge clears the draw votes every time a turn processes: thus 
 you need to cast your vote again.)

Concessions:

Similar to a draw, all players may conceed the game to the largest power.
For this vote, all players still owning SCs must vote unanimously for the 
concession to pass. [Note: different to draws, where you must have units 
to vote.]

Draw Clock:
The GM reserves the right to terminate a game in a draw including all of
the remaining powers, if it is clear that the board has reached a
stalemate. The GM must announce their decision to start the three game-year
Draw Clock during the Fall turn prior to it starting. The clock will then
run until one of the following events occur :

(a) A province changes ownership (where a province is defined as being
owned by the last power to have had a unit in the province at the end of a
fall turn), in which case the clock is stopped and the game continues.
(b) The GM determines that the game is no longer stalemated, in which case
the clock is stopped and the game continues.
(c) The game is declared a draw by all powers entering "set draw".
(d) Three years, ending with the processing of a Fall turn, expires with
none of (a), (b) and (c) occurring, in which case the game is declared a
draw by the GM.

Before the draw clock is started, the following sequence of events should
occur :

(1) A player asks the GM to start the Draw Clock. The GM should never start
the Draw Clock without a request from a player.
(2) The GM determines whether the Draw Clock, if started, is likely to be
stopped by conditions (a) or (b) above. The GM should not proceed unless he
is very confident that the Draw Clock will not be stopped by conditions (a)
or (b).
(3) The GM asks each player in turn, largest power first, as to whether he
would object to the Draw Clock being started, and if he does, then how he
is intending to break the current stalemate. He should not proceed to ask
the next player until either (i) the previous player has replied, or (ii) a
length of time has elapsed since the question was asked, which is at least
as long as the "next" parameter for a minor (retreat or adjustment) phase.
In addition, he should stop asking if a player makes a reasonable objection.
(4) The GM announces via a Broadcast message, that the Draw Clock will be
started at the end of the Fall turn, and states the year in which it will
expire.

A reasonable objection is any plan which the power making the objection is
able to carry out. This includes :

* I have a multi-way guess over [list of provinces], and the other side can
not defend all of them. Eventually I will guess right.
* If nothing happens by [year], I am going to pull my units back from the
line to give the other side some room to manoeuvre.

Unreasonable objections are any plan which the power is unable to carry out
himself. This includes :

* It is clearly in France's interest to stab Germany, and I'm not accepting
a draw until he does.
* I'm just going to sit here until he gets bored and NMRs out, and
hopefully we'll get a less stubborn replacement.

A power repeating a plan which he has given previously and not carried
through with, may be considered an unreasonable objection.

A power giving a flawed plan (e.g. stating that the other side do not have
a guaranteed defence when in fact they do) may also a be considered an
unreasonable objection.

In general, the draw clock is not intended to shorten games. It is intended
to end a game which would be over except for one player refusing to set
draw, but being unable to do anything to alter the position.


Unacceptable behavior:

1) Cheating:

Intentionally circumventing the house rules, the judge mechanism,
or the rules of the particular game can lead to the player being
banned from the judge and all others judges.

2) Cross Play:

Attempting to influence a player's behaviour in one game by offering
threats or concessions in another game is called "cross play". This is
not permitted.

3) Press:

a) The following people can submit press in a game: Players currently in
the game plus players who were in the game but were eliminated,
observers and the GM. (But if you resigned or were kicked out, you have 
no such privileges.)  No player or observer can claim to be the GM, or 
judge keeper. Nor can the GM or judge keeper pretend to be one of the 
others, or a player, if in fact that is not the case.

b) You may forge correspondence from other players within the limits
of the press settings unless you are sending correspondence to the GM.

4) Deception and the GM

The GM will not participate in deceptions involving other players.
The GM will delay the game and ask for new orders from a player if the GM
suspects that a player's orders were faked by another player.

5) Violation of Privacy

Anyone violating the privacy of another player or GM may be ejected
from the game. This specifically refers to electronic mail, but
will be used in other situations if justified.

6) Bad Behavior

Players who are known to NMR, deceive the GM, or are simply known
to be abusive may not be allowed to play on any judge.  And 
players who become abusive to the GM or other players during a game can 
be ejected.

7) Sneaking into a Game

You can not enter a single game as multiple players, use an
alias without prior arrangement, or be "related" to another player. 
Information provided in your registration form must be accurate as mentioned
above. "Related" includes not only blood or legal ties, but friends, work-mates 
and anyone else with whom you have personal links.

Disputes:

The following individuals are responsible for resolving the
disputes in the specified areas. Disputes that cannot be resolved at
that level should be promoted to the next level up.

GM - internal game problems and house rules
Judge keeper - technical problems and house rules, as well as general judge
considerations (such as banning players from the judge).

AH Rules That Have Been Replaced:
(Note: although references are to 1982 rulebook, the changes apply 
 equally to all rulebooks. At time of writing, 4th Edition 2000 rules were 
available online at http://www.hasbro.com/instruct/Diplomacy.PDF.)

1) VII.3.b
When a fleet can move to two coasts and the coast is not specified,
the adjudicator will pick an arbitrary coast.  Actually not totally
arbitrary, but the first one in its movement list.

2) IX.1
Do not specify owners of units in support and convoy orders.  This
redundant specification would unnecessarily complicate the parser.
The movement results will indicate the alternate power on support
and convoy orders.

3)IX.7
Based on the second statement after XIV.5, IX.7 does not apply if
either or both of the dislodged or dislodging unit is convoyed.

4) XII
Armies intending to use a convoy must specify the convoy route
in their movement orders as in the examples:
               A LON-ENG-BEL,
               F ENG C A LON-BEL.
        or     A LON-ENG-MID-WES-TUN,
               F ENG C A LON-TUN,
               F MID C A LON-TUN,
               F WES C A LON-TUN,
               A NAF S A LON-TUN.

5) XII.4
Since convoy routes must be specified, there will never be any ambiguity.

6) XII.5
a) This rule when taken literally can have some unintended results.
For example:
        England: F Iri-Mid, F Eng S F Iri-Mid
        France:  F Spa(nc) S F Mid, F Mid Convoy A Por-Bre, A Por-Mid-Bre
        Italy:   F Gulf of Lyon Convoy A Tus-Spa, A Tus-GoL-Spa

What happens in the Mid-Atlantic ocean?  What about if the additional order:
        Italy:   A Mar S A Tus-Spa
is entered?  With literal interpretation of the rules, the fleet
in Spain would be dislodged, but its support to the fleet in the
Mid-Atlantic Ocean (of an action in a body of water containing a
convoying fleet) would not be cut.  This adjudicator makes five
passes to determine what support gets cut:
        a) Normal non-convoyed movement cuts support.
        b) Any armies being convoyed by fleets that would be dislodged
           without further support cuts are flagged "maybe no convoy".
        c) Any convoyed armies without the "maybe no convoy" status cut
           support provided by units in their destination provinces.
        d) Any armies being convoyed by fleets that still would be
           dislodged are flagged "definitely no convoy".
        e) Any armies still flagged "maybe no convoy" status cut support
           of units in their destination provinces.  The "maybe no convoy"
           status is cleared.

Using this algorithm, Spain's support above would be cut in pass
three.  The Mid-Atlantic Ocean's dislodgement would be detected
in pass four.  Portugal would be given the "no convoy" status and
thus would have no effect on any unit in Brest in pass five.

7) XII.6
This rule is known to be vague and lead to certain paradoxes when a
unit is given the choice between a land route and a convoy. However,
this does not apply here since an army must specifically specify its
convoy route if it is to be convoyed. Note that convoy between
adjacent provinces are possible, and may be useful certain
circumstances.

8) XIII.2
The rule reads as follows: "BUILDING AND REMOVING UNITS
(ADJUSTMENTS).  After the Fall moves have been played, and the
retreats (if any) made, each player's number of units MUST be
adjusted to equal the number of supply centers his Great Power
controls.  If he has fewer centers than units, he MUST disband the
excess units only, by removing them from the board.  The units
removed may be any of his units he choses.  If he has more centers
than units, he MAY build units by placing them..." (Emphasis on MUST
and MAY is not in the original.)

This is vague.  Is the rulebook saying that he MUST disband units and
MAY build units because he can always disband units but is not always
able to build units?  If not, why is the rulebook saying that he MUST
adjust his units to be equal to the number of supply centers that he
controls? 

Here is the replacement rule:  You don't have to accept all possible
builds. Possible builds not being using must be specifically marked
using the WAIVE command or your orders will be marked as unfinished.

9) XIV.4
If a power is required to remove a unit and no valid order is
received, the least recently produced unit that is not at a supply
center will be disbanded.  This is the first one listed on the
reports which will be the one most likely to be furthest away from
a home supply center. (However, in any case NMR is prohibited by above
rules, so this change should have no effect.)

10) COASTAL DESIGNATIONS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ORDERS
The judge requires that an order for a unit supporting a fleet movement
to a bi-coastal province specify the correct coast, otherwise the support
will be void.

Unusual Board Situations:

Certain extremely rare situations are not covered by the rules of
Diplomacy.  (For example, Pandin's paradox discovered by Tony Pandin
in which a convoy causes its own disruption.) In such a situation,
the results of the Diplomacy Adjudicator will be accepted as final.

Other Notes:

1) DIPLOMACY RULES AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
Avalon Hill permits us to run Diplomacy games electronically with
the understanding that no copies of the rules will be distributed
electronically and that all Avalon Hill maps retain the Avalon
Hill copyright. If you violate this understanding, you put the
entire Internet hobby at risk.

2) CHANGE OF ADDRESS
The GM is not responsible for problems caused by you changing your
e-mail address without notifying the GM.
Extra eMail addresses should be added with the IAmAlso command. You 
should do so whenever prompted to by the judge.
Your return address can be changed with the SET ADDRESS command.
To remove an address, re-REGISTER.
