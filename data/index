Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                     18 Jul, 2003
index.

This is an alphabetical list of all the commands that the Judge will process
with a brief description.  It is current as of njudge version 1.5.0.

For information on how to enter Diplomacy orders, get the file 'syntax' (see
"GET file", below).

A number in {curly braces} near the right margin following a command indicates
the earliest Judge version in which the command was implemented.  If no number
is listed, then the command is believed to work on all Judge versions
currently in use, although this has not been verified.

Commands marked {future} are not yet implemented.

Each command is preceded by a code that indicates who can execute the command
and (where applicable) additional restrictions on when the command can be
executed.

The who options are:

any:  Anyone can execute the command (no SIGNON required).  Some commands
      have both an "any" form and a "ply" form; the "any" form is required if
      the command appears before a SIGNON line, and the "ply" form is required
      if it appears after a SIGNON.
ply:  Only a signed-on player or observer can execute the command.  (Unless
      otherwise noted, these commands can be used by a Master, too.)  Any
      exceptions are noted in the command description.
mod:  Only a Master in moderated games, anyone in unmoderated games.
mas:  Only a Master can use these commands; they are not available in
      unmoderated games.
adm:  Only the administrator.  These commands are listed to be complete,
      but should *NOT* be executed by nonadministrators.  If there is any
      doubt, you are not an administrator.

The when options are:

pre:  Must appear before a SIGNON command.
mac:  Can only be used in a Machiavelli variant game, and only before the
      game starts.
bgs:  Can only be used Before Game Starts.

Items in uppercase are keywords and must be entered exactly as specified
(although the command parser actually is not case-sensitive), items in
lowercase are parameters and should have an appropriate value substituted in.
Items in [square brackets] are optional.  Words separated by vertical bars (|)
indicate a choice of one of the words.  In most cases, spaces between keywords
are optional (for example, SIGNON and SIGN ON are equally valid), but spaces
inserted in the middle of a word will cause an error.

Most command parameters are self-explanatory.  "name" means the name of a
game, which must be no more than 8 alphanumeric characters.  "address" means a
valid email address.  "power" means the name (not just the first letter) of
one of the powers in the game, which depends on the variant being played.

Please note: whenever any behavior is described as the "default," that means
it is set that way in the standard Judge software package that is distributed
from devel.diplom.org -- BUT, any Judgekeeper can modify these defaults on his
own Judge installation.  The best way to verify what settings are in effect in
a particular game is to use the "LIST" command.


adm/    ADJUST userid increment
        The increment is added to the player's dedication rating.

ply/bgs BECOME MASTER
        Allows the sole player signed onto a particular game to become the
        master/moderator of that game.  Get file 'master'.  See also command
        "PROMOTE".

mod/    BECOME power
        Allows the moderator for a game to assume the identity of a particular
        power.  Get file 'master'.

ply/    BROADCAST [options]
        To send a press message; options may or not be specified, and the
        message may be terminated by "ENDBROADCAST", "ENDPRESS", "SIGNOFF", or
        the end of the (incoming) mail message.  The adjudicator will send as
        press any text that it encounters until it reaches a line containing
        only one of these three keywords.  In particular, it will ignore any
        orders or other command keywords appearing in the text of press.  Get
        file 'press'.

ply/    CLEAR
        To clear any pending orders entered with the PHASE command.  (Note:
        there is no way to clear orders entered for the current phase.)

any/bgs CREATE ?name password [variant] [option [option ...]]
        To create a new game on the Judge.  This command will fail, of course,
        if the game "name" already exists, or if the Judge is not allowing
        creation of new games.  The game will be Standard unless a variant
        and/or options are specified.  The "variant" and "option"
        specifications for this command are the same as those accepted by the
        "SET VARIANT" command, below.  Get file 'master' for more detail on
        creating games.

ply/	DIARY [option [option]]                                        {1.5.0}
	Diaries allow a player to record his thoughts during the game for
	broadcast at the end of the game.  If the diary command is given
	with no options, it will default to "diary record". Options are:

	RECORD: "DIARY RECORD" begins a new, numbered diary entry. The
	Judge will read until encountering "ENDPRESS", "ENDBROADCAST",
	or "SIGN OFF" (just like a normal press entry).
	LIST: When a player issues "DIARY LIST", the Judge will return
	a numbered list of his created entries, and the date and time they
	were created.
	READ [number]: Issuing "DIARY READ" allows a player to read an
	entry he has already made. The number of the entry to read must
	be specified (it can be obtained from "DIARY LIST").
	DELETE [number]: Deletes the specified diary entry numbers. Note
	that diary entries are not reused, so it's possible to have
	"holes" in the numbering scheme if any entry but the most recent
	one is deleted.

mod/    EJECT power|email                                              {0.8.9}
        A moderator-only command to resign a particular power.  This can be
        done at any time by the moderator.  The moderator MUST use this form
        to resign himself.  If an email address is specified, the command will
        work to resign observers too.  The "EJECT power" form will not work if
        more than one person is signed on to the specified power.

ply/    ENDBROADCAST
        ENDPRESS
        Terminate a Press or Broadcast message.  Note that either form of this
        command will terminate either kind of message.

adm/    FIXID siteid site_name
        Sets all players who have registered with the specified site name to
        have a siteid as indicated.  By default all users get their area code
        times 100 as a siteid and must be fixed to some non- even multiple of
        100.

mod/    FORCE BEGIN                                                    {1.4.0}
        Forces a game to begin, even if not enough players are signed on. The
        missing players will be filled in by 'dummy players' that are already
        abandoned (to allow real people to signon).

any/    GET file
        To get a particular file.  For a complete list of files, get file
        'flist'.  Get file 'info' for a description of the more important
        files.

any/    GET DEDICATION
        To determine the user's current dedication rating statistics.  This
        returns exactly the same information as "INFO PLAYER" for the user's
        mail address.  Before version 1.0.0, it only returned the user's
        dedication point count.

any/    GET PACKAGE
        To get the 'new user package' of files.  These files are generally
        sent automatically to new users at the time they register with a Judge
        (see command "REGISTER"), but they can be specifically requested with
        this command.  These files are the ones that all new users should read
        before attempting any Judge Diplomacy games.

any/    HELP
        The general introduction text is returned, and any other text
        following this line in the email message is ignored.  This is
        equivalent to "GET INFO" followed by "SIGNOFF".

ply/    HELP
        Equivalent to "GET INFO".

any/    HISTORY [name] [FROM date] [TO date] [LINES n]
        HISTORY [name] EXCLSTART turnId [EXCLEND turnId] [BROAD]

        Retrieve (by email) history information for the specified game.  A
        "name" is required unless the command is given after a valid SIGNON,
        in which case the signed-on game is assumed.  The history information
        is all the messages that an observer would have seen had he been
        signed on for the time period.  This includes broadcasts, but not any
        partial press.

        The command "HISTORY [name]" without any other arguments will retrieve
        all history for the period from one week ago (real time) to the
        present, up to a maximum of 1000 lines.  Other command specifications
        can be used to change the time period covered and the length of the
        response.  Get file 'history' for syntax details.

        Finally, note that much game history information can also be retrieved
        from Alain Tésio's exceptional "Diplomacy tools" site,
        http://www.floc.net/

any/    I AM ALSO address
        To register a new email address and link it to an existing
        registration.  If your return address changes you can use this command
        to tell the adjudicator that you are the same person without having to
        resubmit a complete form.  You must send this command _from_ the new
        address.  The address specified must be one that was registered
        previously.

any/    INFO PLAYER address                                            {1.0.0}
        Prints out the current dedication and plyrdata info for the given
        e-mail address.

any/    LIST [FULL|name]
        If no optional name or keyword is specified a short list of the
        current games is generated.  If the FULL keyword is specified a
        detailed report including the player list of each game is generated.
        If a name is specified, the full report for that game is generated
        along with unit positions and supply center holdings.

ply/    LIST
        The detailed report of all players and units will be generated for the
        currently signed on game.

any/    MAP name [n]
        This command is disabled as of version 1.5.0 (but listed here to
        inform users of earlier versions).  You can obtain maps of any game
        on "public" Judges in multiple formats from Alain Tésio's outstanding
        "Diplomacy tools" site, http://www.floc.net/

any/    MAP * [n]
        [Disabled: see previous entry.]

adm/    NOCONTROL
        Prevents broadcast message from actually being sent.  For debugging.

any/    OBSERVE name password
        To become an observer.  This command is equivalent to "SIGNON oname
        password".

ply/    PHASE season year phase
        To specify that any following orders should be held until the
        specified phase before processing.  Get file 'syntax'.

ply/    POSTAL PRESS                                                   {1.2.0}
        If postal press is enabled, this command will append the lines
        following it to the postal press file, until an "END PRESS", "END
        BROADCAST", or "SIGN OFF" is encountered.  When the orders process,
        the postal press file is mailed to everyone signed on to the game.

mod/    PREDICT                                                        {0.8.9}
        Will send to the moderator a prediction of the current turn, using
        partial orders already entered.

ply/    PRESS options
        To send a press message; options must be specified, and the message
        may be terminated by "END BROADCAST", "END PRESS", "SIGN OFF", or the
        end of the (incoming) mail message.  Get file 'press'.

mod/    PROCESS [season year phase]
        Force the judge to process orders immediately with whatever it has in
        its list, even if some orders are missing or erroneous.  The "season
        year phase" specification is optional but _strongly_ recommended.
        Get file 'master'.

mod/    PROMOTE address                                                {0.8.9}
        To promote the observer with the specified email address to also be a
        moderator.

adm/    RECORD userid plyrdata_field value SPECIAL_PW                  {1.0.0}
        Adjusts the given user's plyrdata record field given by field to a
        new value given by value.  Fields are 1 for ontime, 2 for total, 3
        for start, 4 for resignations, and 5 for tookovers.  The SPECIAL_PW
        is defined in dip.conf

any/    REGISTER ... END
        To register yourself.  Get file 'form'.  Also, see command "IAMALSO".

ply/    RESIGN
        To withdraw from the game.  This must be the LAST command in the
        message to be effective; so if you want to broadcast a farewell
        message, do so before you enter the 'resign' command.  The moderator
        cannot RESIGN.  See command "EJECT".

ply/    RESUME
        To restart a completed or terminated game.  The "SET [NO]RESUME"
        command (below) determines whether this command will be accepted from
        any player, or only from a Master.

mod/    ROLLBACK turn
        Rolls the game back to a previously processed turn.  Get file
        'master'.

any/    SEND [ME] file
        Equivalent to "GET file".

ply/    SET [NO] ABSENCE start_date [TO end_date]                      {0.8.7}
        Cancel/request an absence period.  Does not affect the deadline for
        the current phase, but no subsequent deadlines will be set during the
        absence period.  Get file 'absence' for details.

mod/    SET ACCESS ANY[-SITE]|SAME[-SITE]|DIFFERENT[-SITE]
        To change what users can sign on.  "ANY" is the default.  Since the
        "site" setting is dependent on what users put in their registration
        forms, this command is no longer widely used.

ply/    SET ADDRESS [reply_address]
        To change where your reports go.  If you don't specify an address, the
        address from the mail headers (specifically, the _last_ Reply-To:
        header encountered) will be used.  If you signon and the address in
        the mail headers does not match the reporting address you will get two
        replies, one to each address.  This can be fixed by using "set
        address" with no reply address specified.  You can also specify
        multiple addresses separated by commas, but no spaces, to receive
        reports at two (or more) addresses.

mod/mac SET [NO] ADJACENT|ADJACENCY
        Disables/enables optional rule that allows bribes from nonadjacent
        players.

mod/    SET ALL PRESS
        To request that all partial press be sent to you as the moderator of
        the game as well as to the intended recipients.  Use "SET NORMAL
        PRESS" to disable this feature.  Can be used by Observers if the SET
        WATCH ALL PRESS command has been sent by a Master.

mod/    SET ALLOW PLAYER [-]address
        Add an address to the "allow" list for the game; or, using the "-"
        prefix, remove an address from that list.  IMPORTANT:  if the
        moderator creates an "allow" list for a game, then *only* addresses on
        that list will be able to sign on as a player or observer.  This can
        be used to set up an invitation-only game.  See also command "SET DENY
        PLAYER".

adm/    SET ALLOW PLAYER|MASTER [-]address
        Modifies the global "allow" lists for all games on the Judge.  If
        these lists exist, only addresses on the list will be allowed to
        signon to games (for the PLAYER list) or to CREATE games (for the
        MASTER list).  This is only useful for a Judge limited to private
        games.  See also command "SET DENY".

mod/bgs SET ANY CENTRE[S]|CENTER[S]                                    {0.8.9}
        Allows a power to build in any owned centre during a build phase.

mod/bgs+SET ANY DISBAND                                               {future}
        Allow powers to disband any unit during a build phase (and thus
        gaining the option to rebuild on a buildable centre if desired).  A
        'wait' is set for all active players during the build phase.  Opposite
        of "SET NORMAL DISBAND", see below.

mod/mac SET [NO] ASSASSINS|ASSASSINATION[S]
        Disables/enables optional assassination rules.

mod/bgs SET [NO] ATTACK TRANSFORM                                      {0.8.9}
        Transformations on attacked but not dislodged units will fail/work.
        Get file 'transform' for more details.

mod/	SET [NO] AUTO CREATE					       {1.4.1}
 	Disables/enables the automatic creation of a game with identical 
	parameters when the current one finished (in a draw or victory), except
	that the game will be set to 'NoList'. Fails if a sequence number cannot
	be added/incremented on current game name. 	

mod/bgs SET [NO] AUTO DISBAND                                          {0.8.9}
        Disables/enables the autodisband rule.  This rule when enables means
        that units are automatically disbanded when dislodged, i.e.  no
        retreats are permitted.

mod/    SET [NO] AUTO PROC[ESS]                                        {0.8.9}
        Lets the judge automatically process turns when possible.  It is the
        opposite of "SET [NO] MANUAL PROCESS", see below.  The default setting
        is AutoProcess.

mod/bgs SET [NO] AUTO START                                            {0.8.9}
        Allows a game to automatically start when it has a quorum.  It is the
        opposite of "SET [NO] MANUAL START", see below.  This is the default
        setting.

mod/mac SET [NO] BANK[ERS]
        Equivalent to "SET [NO] LOANS".

mod/bgs!SET [NO] BCENTERS|BCENTRES
        Enable/disable the display of ALL owned centres (not just those of
        the power sending the command) in "Blind" variant.  Default disabled.

mod/bgs SET BLANK BOARD                                                {0.8.9}
        Set the game to start in a build phase, with no units, so that players
        can place a different initial stating unit position.  Can only be set
        before the game begins, and has no effect on games that already start
        in a build phase (such as Chaos).

mod/    SET [NO] BLANK PRESS                                           {0.8.9}
        Disables/enables players to send blank press messages.  Usually not
        very useful to enable.

mod/    SET BN|BNC [NUMBER] number
        {Note: This command is no longer of use as Boardman numbers are no
        longer being maintained.  Retained for compatibility only.}
        Sets the Boardman number for a game.  This command should only be
        issued after receiving a number from the Boardman Number Custodian
        (BNC).  Boardman numbers are only assigned to Standard games.  The BNC
        number appears in the game's listing and summary.

ply/    SET [NO] BROADCAST [PRESS]                                     {1.4.0}
        Disables/enables receiving broadcast press messages.  Only possible
        for observers or moderators.

mod/    SET [NO] CD
        Same as "SET [NO] NMR".

mod/    SET CENTERS number
        Set the number of centers required to win the game to "number".  This
        will cause the game to end when the first player reaches this number
        of winning centers.  If more than one player reaches this value, then
        it is advanced to one more center than the top players have.  If a
        draw is acceptable then a vote is required using the SET DRAW command.

mod/bgs SET [NO] COASTAL CONVOYS                                      {0.8.11}
        Disables/enables fleets in coastal provinces from participating in a
        convoy.  Default enabled for Machiavelli games, disabled for all other
        variants (including Machiavelli2).

mod/    SET COMMENT text
        Sets the comment that appears in the brief listing format.  The text
        string should be under 60 characters in length.

mod/    SET COMMENT BEGIN
        Sets the comment that appears in the full listing format.  The full
        comment consists of the rest of the input mail message up to (an
        optional) SIGNOFF command.

ply/    SET [NO] CONC[EDE] p                                          {0.8.10}
        Cast a vote for or against a concession to power 'p' (who must be the
        largest power in the game).  Even though you may only concede to the
        largest power, the Judge requires you to specify the power to be sure
        you really know who you are conceding to.  This command is used only
        in a DIAS game (since, in a NoDias game, you can just set a one-way
        draw).  "SET NO CONCEDE" cancels a previous concession.  As with
        draws, concessions are cleared every time orders are processed, so you
        need to re-set a concession (if you still want it) every phase.
        {Note: must be entered as "SET [NO] CONC" in versions before 1.4.0}

mod/    SET [NO] CONCESSIONS                                          {0.8.10}
        Disables/enables the concession mechanism (see SET CONCEDE, above) in
        DIAS games.  Enabled by default.  

mod/    SET DEADLINE date
        Changes the deadline for the current phase.  Get file 'deadlines'.

mod/    SET DEDICATION level
        Restricts access to the game to those people with a dedication rating
        equal or greater than the indicated level.  The indicated level can
        not be higher than the Moderator's current dedication rating.  For
        information on dedication ratings, get the file 'dedsystems'.

mod/    SET DENY PLAYER [-]address
        Add an address to the "deny" list for the game; or, using the "-"
        prefix, remove an address from that list.  Any address on this list
        will be unable to sign on as a player or observer.  See also "SET
        ALLOW PLAYER".  Note that the "deny" list is not checked if an "allow"
        list exists.

adm/    SET DENY PLAYER|MASTER [-]address
        Modifies the global "deny" lists for all games on the Judge.  If these
        lists exist, addresses on the list will not be able to signon to games
        (for the PLAYER list) or to CREATE games (for the MASTER list).  See
        also "SET ALLOW".

mod/    SET [NO] DIAS
        Disables/enables requirement that all draws must include all
        survivors.  Default is "DIAS".  Get file 'draws'.

mod/mac SET [NO] DICE
        Disables/enables optional rules that introduce random events into the
        game: Variable income, bank loans, assassinations, famine and plague.

        Disables/enables the use of a disband order during a normal movement
        phase.  Default enabled for Machiavelli, disabled for Machiavelli2 and
        all other variants.

ply/    SET [NO] DRAW [powerlist]
        Cast a vote in an automated draw.  The "powerlist" option is only
        valid if the game is set NoDIAS.  Any draw vote, DIAS or NoDIAS, is
        good for one phase only.  All draw votes are cleared at the end of a
        phase.  Get file 'draws'.

mod/bgs SET [NO] DUALITY                                              {0.8.11}
        Disables/enables provinces with dual behaviour (both land and water).
        This is disabled by default in Standard games, and is only available
        as an option in certain variants where it is coded into the map file.
        Get file 'duality'.

mod/bgs SET EMPTY BOARD                                                {0.8.9}
        The same as "SET BLANK BOARD", see above.

mod/    SET EP number
        {Note: This command is no longer of use as EP numbers are no
        longer being maintained.  Retained for compatibility only.}
        Sets the Electonic Protocol number for a game.  This command should
        only be issued after receiving a number from the Electronic Protocol
        Number Keeper (EPNK).  The EP number appears in the game's listing and
        summary.

mod/    SET NO FAKE [BROADCAST]
        Get file 'press'.

mod/mac SET [NO] FAMINE
        Disables/enables optional famine rules.

        Disables/enables gateways, in a variant that has this option coded
        into its map file.  Get file 'info.colonial'.

mod/    SET GRACE date
        Changes the grace period for the current phase.  Get file 'deadlines'.

mod/    SET GREY [PRESS]
        Sets press option to grey only.  Get file 'press'.

mod/    SET NO GREY [PRESS]
        Same as "SET WHITE".

mod/    SET GREY/WHITE [PRESS]
        Sets press option to grey by default with white allowed.  Get file
        'press'.

ply/    SET [NO] HOLIDAY[S]                                            {0.8.7}
        Same as SET [NO] ABSENCE.

mod/bgs SET HOME CENTRE[S]|CENTER[S]                                   {0.8.9}
        Allow builds to be made only in the building power's home centers
        during build phase.  (Default setting for Standard games.)

        Disables/Enables "HongKong" rule in a variant that has this option
        coded into its map file.  Get file 'info.colonial'.

mod/    SET [NO] LATE COUNT                                            {0.8.9}
        Disables/enables late counting.  If enabled, every time a player is
        late the late messages will include a count of the number of times
        this player has been late in the game.  This counter will be reset
        when a new player takes over.

mod/    SET [NO] LATE PRESS                                            {0.8.9}

        press (except to the moderator).

mod/    SET LEVEL ANY|NOVICE|AMATEUR|INTERMEDIATE|ADVANCED|EXPERT
        Restricts access to a particular class of player.  The three official
        classes are Novice, Intermediate, and Expert.  Amateur means either
        Novice or Intermediate, and Advanced means either Intermediate or
        Expert.  "Any" of course means any class of player may play (and is
        the default).  Players can change their classification (if they feel
        their level has changed) by re-registering.  See command "REGISTER".

mod/    SET [NO] LIST
        Enables/disables public listing of the game.  If a game is set NoList
        (the default) then only people who know about it will be able to see
        it.  Useful for "by invitation only" games.  Get file 'master'.

mod/mac SET [NO] LOANS
        Disables/enables optional rules allowing players to borrow money from
        the bank.

mod/bgs SET [NO] MACH2                                                 {1.0.2}
        Disables/enables Machiavelli 2nd Edition (1995) rules.

mod/    SET [NO] MANUAL PROCESS                                        {0.8.9}
        Disables/enables the requirement that the turn will only occur when
        the moderator executes the 'PROCESS' command.  Disabled by default.

mod/bgs SET [NO] MANUAL START                                          {0.8.9}
        Disables/enables the requirement that the game will only start when
        the moderator allows.  If game was ManualStart and ready to go, then
        SET NO MANUAL START (or SET AUTO START) will start it.  Disabled by
        default.

mod/    SET MAX ABSENCE number                                         {0.8.7}
        Sets the maximum absence duration that a player can set, in days.
        Default is 15.  This does not apply to absences set by the moderator.
        The parameter 'number' can be set no higher than 31 and no lower than
        0.  Get file 'absence' for further details.

mod/bgs SET [NO] MINOR PRESS                                           {0.8.9}
        Disables/enables the sending of press message during minor phases
        (retreats and builds).  FTF (and many postal) games commonly do not
        allow minor phase negotiations, Judge games historically have.  Cannot
        be changed once the game is in progress.

mod/    SET MN|MNC [NUMBER] number
        {Note: This command is no longer of use as Miller numbers are no
        longer being maintained.  Retained for compatibility only.}
        Sets the Miller number for a game.  This command should only be issued
        after receiving a number from the Miller Number Custodian (MNC).
        Miller numbers are only assigned to non-Standard games.  The MNC
        number appears in the game's listing and summary.

ply/    SET MODERATE[D]
        Changes a game from unmoderated to moderated.  This is set by default
        by the "BECOME MASTER" command.

mod/mac SET [NO] MONEY                                                {0.8.11}
        Disables/enables money in Machiavelli games.  Without money,
        Machiavelli is similar to normal Diplomacy, where you need to own one
        city for each unit built.

mod/    SET MOVE|RETREAT|ADJUST setting value [setting value ...]
        To change the deadline calculation.  The "setting" may be any one (or
        more) of CLOCK, MIN, NEXT, GRACE, DELAY, or DAYS.  "Value" is a
        decimal number, except following "DAYS".  Get file 'deadlines'.

mod/    SET [NO] MUST ORDER                                            {1.2.0}
        Sets and unsets the MustOrder flag.  If this flag is set, players
        must have valid orders submitted before sending press.

mod/    SET [NO] NMR
        Allows/prevents processing of orders if all powers have not yet
        submitted complete ones.  Default is "NONMR".

mod/    SET NO PRESS
        Disables all press/broadcast messages.  Get file 'press'.

mod/    SET [PRESS] NONE
        Same as "SET NO PRESS".

ply/    SET [NO] NORMAL BROADCAST                                      {0.8.9}
        Same as "SET [NO] BROADCAST [PRESS]", above.

mod/bgs SET NORMAL DISBAND                                             {0.8.9}
        Uses the standard rules for disbands on a build turn; i.e., a power
        can only disband when it has more units than centres.  Opposite of
        "SET ANY DISBAND" (see above).

mod/    SET NORMAL PRESS
        Disables the "SET ALL PRESS" option where all partial press is sent to
        Masters.  May also be used by Observers if "SET WATCH ALL PRESS" has
        been used.

mod/    SET OBSERVER ANY [PRESS]
        Permits observers and alternates to submit press with the same
        restrictions as regular players.

mod/    SET OBSERVER NO [PRESS]
        Disallows press from observers and alternates.

mod/    SET OBSERVER WHITE [PRESS]
        Disallows observers and alternates from submitting grey press.

mod/bgs SET ONE CENTRE[S]|CENTER[S]                                    {0.8.9}
        Allow a power to build in any owned centre during a build phase, as
        long as one home centre is still owned.

mod/    SET ONTIMERAT level                                            {0.8.9}
        Restricts access to the game to those people with an ontime ratio
        equal then or greater than the indicated level.  The indicated level
        can not be higher than the moderator's.  For information on the ontime
        ratio, get the file 'dedsystems'.

mod/    SET [NO] PARTIAL [PRESS]
        Enables/disables the ability for players to send messages to
        individual powers.  Get file 'press'.  (Partial press to and from the
        moderator is always enabled.)

mod/    SET PARTIAL [FAKES [BROADCAST]] [BY DEFAULT]
        Get file 'press'.

mod/    SET PARTIAL MAY [BE FAKED]
        Get file 'press'.

ply/    SET PASSWORD new_password
        To change your password for the signed-on game.  Passwords must
        contain only alphanumeric characters.

mod/mac SET [NO] PLAGUE
        Disables/enables optional plague rules.

mod/bgs SET PLAYERS number
        Sets the number of players (not powers) in the game.  When the number
        of players is set to some number less than the number of powers, the
        game will begin when that number of players signs on to the game,
        assigning excess powers evenly among the players, thus enabling them
        to play multiple powers.  Get file 'info.duplex' for more information
        and an example.

mod/   !SET [NO] POSTAL PRESS                                          {1.2.0}
        Turns postal press on/off.  Postal press is press published with the
        results of the turn.  See command "POSTAL PRESS" for more details.

ply/bgs SET PREFERENCE list
        To establish a preference list for power assignment.  Should appear
        immediately after an initial SIGNON entering a forming game.  Can be
        modified up until the powers are actually assigned.

        There are two formats for "list", depending on the game's preference
        setting (see SET PRFBOTH, SET PRFLIST, SET PRFRAND below).
        
        If the setting is PRFLIST or PRFBOTH, the "list" may contain initials
        of the various powers in the game, arranged with the player's most
        preferred power listed first.  For instance, "SET PREFERENCE ATRIFEG"
        could be used by a player who has a strong desire to play an eastern
        power.  A player may indicate that he has an equal preference for two
        or more powers by enclosing them in square brackets.  For example,
        "SET PREFERENCE E[FGR][TAI]" would indicate that the player's first
        choice is England; after that, he would prefer any of France, Germany,
        or Russia equally; and after that would take any of the remaining
        powers.  The Judge assigns powers by assigning each player's first
        choice a weight of 7, the second choice a weight of 6, etc., and
        averaging the weights for powers combined in square brackets; these
        weights are used in an algorithm that maximizes the overall total
        weight of the power assignments.

        If the setting is PRFBOTH OR PRFRAND, then "list" may be a single
        asterisk ("SET PREFERENCE *").  (In fact, if the game setting is
        PRFRAND, this is the only possible preference list, so there is really
        no point in using SET PREFERENCE.)  This signifies that the player
        will receive a randomly selected power (and these assignments are made
        *before* the Judge looks at other players' preference lists).
        
        If a player's preference list is empty, or the Judge runs out of
        preferences because the player did not list all available powers, the
        Judge will proceed as if all the remaining powers were listed in
        square brackets at the end of the list.  As a practical matter, this
        likely means that that player will receive a random assignment *after*
        all other players' preference lists have been processed.  In other
        words, an empty (or missing) preference list is *not* the same as "SET
        PREFERENCE *".

mod/bgs SET PRFBOTH                                                    {1.1.0}
        To have the judge assign a random power to any player that requests it
        (by entering "SET PREFERENCE *"), and powers according their
        preference lists to all other players.

mod/bgs SET PRFLIST                                                    {1.1.0}
        To have the judge assign powers exclusively using the preference
        lists entered by the players.  (This is the default.)

mod/bgs SET PRFRAND                                                    {1.1.0}
        To have the judge randomly assign powers to all players.

mod/    SET PRIVATE
        Equivalent to "SET NOLIST".

mod/    SET [NO] PROXY
        Clear/set the flag that allows one player to give control of one or
        more of his units to another player.  Proxy ordering is disabled by
        default.  Get file 'syntax' for proxy syntax.

mod/    SET PUBLIC
        Equivalent to "SET LIST".

mod/    SET [NO] QUIET
        Sets (or clears) the "quiet" flag.  This flag prevents announcements
        about power abandonment, power takeovers and such from being broadcast
        to the other players or observers.  Its purpose is to prevent
        information from being disclosed in gunboat games, particularly
        tournaments where multiple games may lose the same player.

mod/bgs SET [NO] RAILWAYS                                             {0.8.11}
        Disables/enables railways, in a variant that has this option coded
        into its map file.  Get file 'info.colonial'.

mod/    SET [UN]RATED
        Changes a game to rated or unrated.  By default moderated games are
        rated and unmoderated games are unrated.  Unrated games will not
        affect the players' dedication rating.

mod/    SET RESRAT level                                               {0.8.9}
        Restricts access to the game to those people with a CD ratio lower
        than or equal to the indicated level.  The indicated level can not be
        lower than the moderator's.  For information on the CD ratio, get
        file 'dedsystems'.

mod/    SET [NO] RESUME                                                {0.8.9}
        Enables/disables players from resuming a game.  If enabled, any player
        can resume a terminated game.  If disabled, only the moderator can.
        WARNING: on many Judges, the default setting allows players to resume
        games after termination.  In moderated games, the use of "SET
        NO RESUME" is strongly recommended.

mod/    SET [NO] REVEAL
        If a gunboat game is set "NoReveal", the player list will not be
        revealed in summary output after the game terminates.  This flag is
        useful for gunboat tournaments where player lists may be the same in
        multiple games.

mod/    SET [NO] SECRET                                                {1.1.0}
        Sets/clears the "Secret" flag.  This flag prevents any information
        about the number of players in the game from being revealed to the
        players or observers.  It is intended for use in duplex games.

mod/    SET [NO] SHOW
        If a game is set to "NoSHow", changes to game settings will appear to
        be made by 'someone@somewhere'.  Otherwise, the changer will have
        their email shown.  The default is "NoShow" for Gunboat games, and
        "Show" for all other games.

mod/mac SET [NO] SPECIAL
        Disables/enables optional rules that allow double strength units.

mod/    SET START date
        Sets the earliest date/time at which orders can be processed for the
        current phase.  Get file 'deadlines'.

mod/mac SET [NO] STORM[S]                                              {1.0.2}
        Disables/enables storms.  Works as per plague, except causes fleets at
        sea to be eliminated randomly (in a storm).

mod/   !SET [NO] STRICT CONVOY                                         {0.8.9}
        Allows/disallows "implausible" convoys.  Default disabled, so fleets
        can be ordered to convoy any army to any province defined in the map
        file.  If set, only convoys that could conceivably succeed may be
        ordered.  (As of the current version, the plausibility checking is
        actually minimal; it only rejects convoys if either the origin or
        destination space has no adjacent sea spaces.)

mod/    SET [NO] STRICT GRACE
        Disables/enables enforcement of grace period as an ABSOLUTE time
        interval after the deadline.  If disabled (default), then grace
        periods will always end on an appropriate order processing day.

mod/    SET [NO] STRICT WAIT
        Determines the ability of players who can set the WAIT flag.  If
        STRICTWAIT is set, only players who have moves currently required will
        be allowed to set wait.  If NOSTRICTWAIT is set (default), any
        currently active player can set wait.

mod/    SET TRANSFORM transform-option                                 {0.8.9}
        SET TRAFO transform-option
        Enables unit transformations, according to 'transform-option'.  Get
        file 'transform' for details.

mod/    SET NO TRANSFORM                                               {0.8.9}
        SET NO TRAFO
        Disables the transformation of units.  This is the default for
        Standard games.  Warning: this command does not work in njudge version
        1.3.1 and earlier!

mod/    SET UNLIST
        Equivalent to "SET NO LIST".

mod/    SET UNMODERATE[D]
        Changes a game from moderated to unmoderated.

ply/    SET [NO] VACATION[S]                                           {0.8.7}
        Same as SET [NO] ABSENCE.

mod/bgs SET VARIANT variant|option
        To change the variant of a game, or add an optional rule.  This can
        only be done before the powers are assigned and before the requisite
        number of players for the new variant type have signed on.  SET
        VARIANT can only be used to set one option per command (unlike
        CREATE).  For a complete list of valid variants and options, send the
        command "SIGNON ?name password XXXX", or "SET VARIANT XXXX" if already
        signed on as Master or as player in an unmoderated game (where XXXX is
        any invalid variant name).  Note: if the game has been set as a
        variant and it is desired to un-set this, use "SET VARIANT STANDARD".

mod/bgs SET NOT VARIANT option
        Disable the specified optional rule.  This command can only be used to
        remove options, not to change the underlying variant type.  To change
        the variant itself, use "SET VARIANT". 

ply/    SET [NO] WAIT
        Clears/sets the wait flag; if the moderator or any (eligible) player
        has this flag set, orders will not be processed until the deadline.
        See also "SET STRICT WAIT".  This flag is automatically cleared when
        orders are actually processed (not necessarily at the deadline), and
        must be set again for the next phase.

mod/    SET [NO] WATCH ALL PRESS                                       {0.8.9}
        Allows observers to use the "SET ALL PRESS" command to see partial
        press between players.  Use with caution to avoid gunboat security
        breaches.

mod/    SET WHITE [PRESS]
        Sets press option to white only.  Get file 'press'.

mod/    SET NO WHITE [PRESS]
        Same as "SET GREY".

mod/    SET WHITE/GREY [PRESS]
        Sets press option to white by default with grey allowed.  See
        file 'press'.

any/    SIGN OFF
        To indicate the end of useful text.  The SIGN OFF command is used
        to prevent your signature file (or taglines inserted by your e-mail
        provider) from being interpreted as orders and/or being sent out as
        part of a press message.

any/    SIGN ON pname password
        To sign onto an existing power that you own or to take over an
        abandoned power.  Please note: it is only possible to have one SIGN ON
        command (or equivalents, such as CREATE or OBSERVE) per mail message.
        Only registered users may take over an abandoned power.  However, any
        user may SIGN ON to an existing position if they use the correct
        password.  This allows you to access your games from a secondary email
        account.  If the SIGN ON command does not come from the player of
        record, a copy of the Judge's response will be sent to that player as
        a precaution against cheating.

any/    SIGN ON ? password
        To enter the next available game that is forming.

any/    SIGN ON ?name password [variant] [options]
        To enter a particular game that is forming.  The "variant" and
        "options" specifications are required if, and only if, these options
        were used in the CREATE or SET VARIANT command.  See "SET VARIANT".
        Only registered users may signon to a forming game.

any/    SUMMARY name
        To get an historical summary of the specified game indicating who took
        what power over when and which supply centers each power owned
        throughout the game.

ply/    SUMMARY
        To get the summary report for the signed on game as above.  The
        moderator in a gunboat game will get a slightly different summary that
        includes the actual player names and addresses rather than the generic
        "someone@somewhere".

mod/    TERMINATE
        To declare the game over.  If the game has not started, it will be
        ended and no-one can ever sign onto it again.

mod/    UNSTART                                                        {1.1.0}
        To return the game to the position immediately prior to the start of
        the game.  Powers will be unassigned and the game will be flagged
        manualstart.  Games can only be unstarted if no turns have yet
        processed.

        This can be useful if a player is ejected or resigns; the game can be
        unstarted, so a replacement can enter a preference list rather than
        have to take whichever power left.

any/pre VERSION [level]
        To see the current version of the software.  The optional level
        specification is not currently used, but in some future version may
        generate a log of changes since the specified version.

any/pre WATCH name password
        Equivalent to "OBSERVE".

any/    WHO user [user ...]
        Equivalent to "WHOIS".

any/pre WHO GAME name [FULL]
        Retrieves WHOIS information for all players associated with game
        "name".  If the game is gunboat this command can only be used by the
        moderator (and only after he signs on).  The optional "FULL" argument
        will return information for observers and alternates as well, while
        the default only returns information for the players and the
        moderator.  See also "WHOIS" below.

ply/    WHO GAME [FULL]
        Retrieves WHOIS information for all players associated with the
        currently signed on game.  If the game is gunboat, only the moderator
        can use this command.  The optional "FULL" argument will return
        information for observers and alternates as well, while the default
        only returns information for the players and the moderator.  See also
        "WHOIS" below.

any/    WHO IS user [user ...]
        To retrieve registration information for particular players.  All
        registered people with mail addresses that start with a prefix that
        matches any of the "user" words specified will be listed.  Thus the
        command "WHO IS p" will list all users who have an email address that
        starts with a P.  The entire database can be retrieved with the "GET
        WHOIS" command (although this may be disabled by the Judgekeeper).

ply/    WITHDRAW
        Equivalent to "RESIGN".
