Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                25th Feb 2002
index.

(Note: New commands for this judge version are marked with an '*'.
       Still to be implemented ones are marked with a '+'.)

This is an alphabetical list of all the commands that the adjudicator will
process with a brief description.  Each command is preceded by a who/where
pair.  This indicates who can execute the command and where the command
can appear.  The who options are:

any:  Anyone can execute the command.
mod:  Only the moderator in moderated games, anyone in unmoderated games.
adm:  Only the administrator.  These commands are listed to be complete,
      but should *NOT* be executed by nonadministrators.  If there is any
      doubt, you are not an administrator.

The where options are:

any:  Can appear either before or after a signon command.
pre:  Must appear before a signon command.
aft:  Can only appear after a signon command.
mac:  Can only appear after a signon to a Machiavelli variant game.

Items in square brackets are optional, items in uppercase are keywords
and must be entered exactly as specified, items in lowercase are
parameters and should have an appropriate value substituted in.  Words
separated by vertical bars (|) indicate a choice of one of the words.


adm/pre ADJUST userid increment
        The increment is added to the player's dedication rating.

any/aft BECOME MASTER
        Allows the sole player signed onto a particular game to become
        the master/moderator of that game.  See file 'master'.

mod/aft BECOME power
        Allows the master for a game to assume the identity of a particular
        power.  See file 'master'.

any/aft BROADCAST [options] ... [ENDBROADCAST|ENDPRESS|SIGNOFF]          
        To send a press message; options may or not be specified, and the
        message may be terminated by 'ENDBROADCAST', 'ENDPRESS', 'SIGNOFF',
        or the end of the (incoming) mail message.  See file 'press'.

any/aft CLEAR
        To clear any pending orders entered with the PHASE command.

mod/aft*EJECT power-or-email
        A master-only command to resign a particular power. This can be done at
        any time by the master. The master MUST use this form to resign himself.
        The <power-or-email> specification can also be an email address, and will
        work with observers too.

adm/pre FIXID siteid site_name
        Sets all players who have registered with the specified site name
        to have a siteid as indicated.  By default all users get their
        area code times 100 as a siteid and must be fixed to some non-
        even multiple of 100.

any/any GET file
        To get a particular file.  For a complete list of files see file
        'flist'.  See file 'info' for a description of the more important
        files.

any/any GET DEDICATION
	To determine the users current dedication rating.

any/any GET PACKAGE
        To get the 'new user package' of files.  These files are generally
        sent automatically to new users at the time they register with a
        Judge (see REGISTER command), but they can be specifically requested
        with this command.  These files are the ones that all new users
        should read before attempting any Judge Diplomacy games.

any/pre HELP
        The general introduction text is returned.  This is equivalent to
        the "get info" command except that no other commands after the help 
        command will be processed.

any/aft HELP
        Equivalent to "get info".

any/any HISTORY [game] [FROM date] [TO date] [LINES n]
        HISTORY [game] EXCLSTART turnId [EXCLEND turnId] [BROAD]

        The first form:
	Retrieves the history information for the specified game for the
	specified time period (in real time rather than game time).  The
	history information is all the messages that an observer would 
	have seen had he been signed on for the time period.  The default
	period is 1 week ago to the present or 1000 lines whichever comes
	first.

        Dates can be specified in the following forms (only spaces should
	be used to separate parts of a date, except a comma is optionally
	allowed after the day of the month):
	       a)  Day of week (three-letter abbreviation)
	       b)  Day and month (three-letter abbreviation), or month and day
	       c)  Day, month, and year, or month, day, and year, where year
		   can be specified either as 80-99 (= 1980-1999) or four digits.
		   Also, a time in hours and minutes (i.e., 'hh:mm' form, using a
		   24-hour clock) can be added after any of the above if desired;
		   otherwise, the time defaults to midnight (00:00) of the specified
		   day.

        To get the earliest part of the history (or the whole history), use
        a date that is known to be earlier than the game start date; 1 Jan
	1990 (or Jan 1, 1990) is usually sufficient for this purpose.

        The second form:
        Retrieves the history information for the specified game excluding
	phases starting from EXCLSTART turnId to [EXCLEND turnId].
	Note: EXCLSTART is not optional.
	In the case where [EXCLEND turnId] is not specified, the returned
	history contains turns from start of game to (but not including)
	EXCLSTART turn.

        The format for 'turnId' is: SYYYYT
          where:  S - the season (ex: 'S' for Spring, or 'F' for Fall)
                  Y - each digit in the year. (ex: 1901, 1425, 1999)
                  T - Turn (ex: 'M' for Movement Phase, 'B' for builds, 'R' for Retreats)

        More concrete examples: 
                S1902M (Spring 1902 Movement Phase)
                F1999B (Fall 1999 Adjustment(Builds) Phase)

        No checking is done to determine whether the TurnIds given are
	actually found in the game.  The default action for the second form,
	on erroneous turnIds, is to return a complete history, noting the
        exception below.

        By default 'Diplomacy notices' are not included. However, if a draw
        notice is found outside the excluded set of phases the draw notice
	will be included, regardless of [BROAD] flag status.
	[BROAD] must be, explicitly, given to have notices included
	in the history.  In the worst case, with [BROAD] command, the
	returned message can be anywhere from 200 Kb to as much as 1 Mb.
	(BEWARE! using this flag.)

any/any IAMALSO address   
		  To register a new email address.  If your return address changes
		  you can use the IamAlso command to tell the adjudicator that you
		  are the same person without having to resubmit a complete form.
		  The address specified must be one that was registered previously.

any/any*INFOPLAYER address
	Prints out the current dedication and plyrdata info for the given 
	e-mail address.

any/pre LIST [FULL|name]
        If no optional name or keyword is specified a short list of the
        current games is generated.  If the FULL keyword is specified
        a detailed report including the player list of each game is
        generated.  If a name is specified, the full report for that game
        is generated along with unit positions and supply center holdings.

any/aft LIST
        The detailed report of all players and units will be generated
        for the currently signed on game.

any/pre MAP name [n]
        Send a postscript map of the current status of the game. Not all
        variants are supported. The "n" option sends the file in plain
        postscript format instead of uuencoded, compressed ps format.
	(This command may be disabled)

any/pre MAP * [n]
	This command must prefix a LIST output from any judge and will
	produce a map based on that output. The "*" is real and is not
	replaced. The "n" option is as above.
	The LIST output supplied must *not* have any characters added to
	the beginning of the line. e.g: The comment (">") character.
	(This command may be disabled)
        
adm/pre NOCONTROL
        Prevents broadcast message from actually being sent.  For debugging.

        may be terminated by 'ENDBROADCAST', 'ENDPRESS', 'SIGNOFF', or the
        end of the (incoming) mail message.  See file 'press'.

mod/aft*PROMOTE address
	To promote the observer with the specified address to also be a master.

adm/pre*RECORD userid plyrdata_field value SPECIAL_PW
        Adjusts the given user's plyrdata record field given by field to a
        new value givden by value. Fields are 1 for ontime, 2 for total, 3
	for start, 4 for resignations, and 5 for tookovers. The SPECIAL_PW
	is defined in dip.conf

any/any REGISTER ... END  
        To register yourself.  See file 'form'.

any/aft RESIGN
        To withdraw from the game.  This must be the LAST command in the

        To restart a completed or terminated game

mod/aft ROLLBACK turn
        Rolls the game back to the previously processed turn.  See file

any/aft SET ADDRESS  [reply_address]  
        To change where your reports go.  If you don't specify an address
        the address from the mail headers will be used.  If you signon and
        your the address in the mail headers does not match the reporting
        address you will get two replies, one to each address.  This can
        be fixed by using "set address" with no reply address specified.

mod/aft*SET ALL PRESS
	To request that all partial press be sent to you as the moderator
	of the game as well as to the intended recipients.  Use "SET NORMAL

	as well, while the default only returns information for the players
	and the master.  See also "whois" below.

	players and the master.  See also "whois" below.

        command "whois p" will list all users who have an email address that
        starts with a P.  The entire database can be retreived with the
