Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                  Jan 3, 2000
Syntax.

The format of your diplomacy orders depends on the phase of the game:
Movement, Retreats or Adjustments.  Multiple orders can be entered on 
one line by separating them with commas or semicolons.

Movement orders:

[<type>] <s_prov> <holds>
[<type>] <s-prov> <moves>   <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <moves>   <c-prov> <moves> <c-prov> ... <moves> <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <support> [<type>] <s-prov> 
[<type>] <s-prov> <support> [<type>] <s-prov> <moves> <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <convoy>  [<type>] <s-prov> <moves> <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <proxy>   <power>
[<type>] <s-prov> <transforms> <type>

Retreat orders:

<type> <s-prov> <moves>   <d-prov>
<type> <s-prov> <disband>

Adjustment orders:

<build>  <type> <s-prov>
<remove> [<type>] <s-prov>
<transform> [<type>] <s-prov> <to> <type>
<waive>

Where:

<type>    = "army", "a", "fleet", "f", "wing", "w" or <empty>.
<s-prov>  = Source province.
<d-prov>  = Destination province.
<c-prov>  = Intermediate water province in a convoy route.
<power>   = Power name or abbreviation of two or more characters.
<holds>   = "h", "hold", "holds", "stand", "stands".
<moves>   = "-", "->", "m", "move", "moves", "move to", "moves to".
<support> = "s", "support", "supports".
<convoy>  = "c", "convoy", "convoys", "transport", "transports" , "t",
	    "fast ferry", "ferry", "ff", "f"
<proxy>   = "p", "proxy", "proxy to".
<disband> = "d", "disband", "disbands".
<build>   = "b", "build" or <empty>.
<remove>  = "r", "remove", "d", "disband" or <empty>.
<waive>   = "w", "waive".
<transforms> = "transforms to", "transform to", "transform", "transforms",
		"trafo","tr".
<tranform> = "transform", "transforms", "trafo"
<to>	  = "to", "->"

Province names can be abbreviated or can be spelled out.  Coasts can be
specified by following the province name with one of:

<coast>   = "/nc", "(nc)", "/north coast", "(north coast)"

or appropriate other directions instead of 'north'.


Revisions to orders can be sent in anytime before the deadline occurs.
The last valid order for a particular unit will be honored.  If no valid
order is received for a particular unit it will be listed in the reports
as "No order processed".


Orders can be entered conditionally using the following syntax:

  if <condition> then
    <orders>
  else if <condition> then
    <orders>
  else
    <orders>
  endif

The "then"s are optional for old fortran programmers.  The conditions
are of the form:

<condition> = ["not"] <power> <type> <prov>

and may be combined with the keywords "and" and "or" evaluated left
to right.  You can use parenthesis to change the precidence.  The 
condition evaluates to "true" if a unit of the specified type belonging 
to the specified power is present (or not) in the specified province.  
The province must be specified, but the type and power are optional
interpreted as "any" if not specified.  The power, type and province
can be specified in any order.  Powers can be abbreviated to two or
more characters or spelled out.  For example:

   phase Fall 1905 Movement
   if not french army ruhr and (russian prussia or russian siliesia)
     kiel -> berlin
     munich support kiel -> berlin
   else
     kiel -> ruhr
     munich support kiel -> ruhr
   endif

Conditional statements can be nested with expected results.  The end of
a line closes off all parenthesis and the end of the orders closes off
all missing endifs without an error being reported.  Note, broadcast
messages are not considered orders and thus cannot be sent out
conditionally using this mechanism.


Orders can be submitted for future phases using the following syntax:

    PHASE <season> <year> <phase>

Where the first letter of the season or phase are significant:

    <season> = "Spring", "Summer", "Fall" or "Winter".
    <phase>  = "Movement", "Retreat", "Adjustment" or "Build".

The orders following the PHASE directive will be collected and saved
until the indicated phase occurs.  Some syntax checking will be done on
the orders, but the full list of errors can't be determined until the
actual phase occurs.  That error list will be mailed to you when the
orders are processed.  If any pending orders are found for a particular
phase, your power will get the "orders have been received" status
automatically whether or not there were any errors or if the orders are
incomplete.  All orders until the next PHASE directive or the end of
the mail message will be saved for the specified phase.  Note that only
orders are saved.  In particular, BROADCAST MESSAGES CANNOT BE DELAYED
for later transmission.  An exception to this is that the "set wait"
and "set nowait" directives will be propagated to the future phase.
Your pending orders will be listed in replies to intervening order
submissions.  To get rid of all your pending orders, use the CLEAR
command.

As a special note, please be aware that subsequent build orders will
override earlier ones if more build orders are received than you have
supply centers.  Thus, when submitting orders for future build phases,
you should list your builds in reverse order of preference in case you
don't get as many supply centers as you were expecting.
