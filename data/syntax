Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                      19 May, 2003
Syntax.

The format of your diplomacy orders depends on the phase of the game:
Movement, Retreats or Adjustments.  Multiple orders can be entered on
one line by separating them with commas or semicolons.  

WARNING: the Judge syntax is different than in the standard Diplomacy rules in
two circumstances: (1) when supporting or convoying another power's unit, you
must *not* include the unit's nationality in your order; (2) when an army is
ordered to move by convoy, it must list each sea space that it will pass
through.  See the section below titled "CONVOY ROUTES MUST BE SPECIFIED."

Movement orders:

[<type>] <s-prov> <holds>
[<type>] <s-prov> <moves>   <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <moves>   <c-prov> <moves> <c-prov> ... <moves> <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <support> [<type>] <s-prov> 
[<type>] <s-prov> <support> [<type>] <s-prov> <moves> <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <convoy>  [<type>] <s-prov> <moves> <d-prov>
[<type>] <s-prov> <proxy>   <power>
[<type>] <s-prov> <transforms> <type>

Retreat orders:

<type> <s-prov> <moves>   <d-prov>
<type> <s-prov> <disband>

Adjustment orders:

<build>  <type> <s-prov>
<remove> [<type>] <s-prov>
<transform> <type> <s-prov>
<waive>

Where:

<type>       = "army", "a", "fleet", "f", "wing", "w" or <empty>.
<s-prov>     = Source province.
<d-prov>     = Destination province.
<c-prov>     = Intermediate water province in a convoy route.
<power>      = Power name or abbreviation of two or more characters.
<holds>      = "h", "hold", "holds", "stand", "stands".
<moves>      = "-", "->", "m", "move", "moves", "move to", "moves to".
<support>    = "s", "support", "supports".
<convoy>     = "c", "convoy", "convoys", "transport", "transports" , "t",
	         "fast ferry", "ferry", "ff", "f"
<proxy>      = "p", "proxy", "proxy to".
<disband>    = "d", "disband", "disbands".
<build>      = "b", "build" or <empty>.
<remove>     = "r", "remove", "d", "disband" or <empty>.
<waive>      = "w", "waive".
<transforms> = "transforms to", "transform to", "transform", "transforms",
		   "trafo", "tr".
<transform>  = "transform", "transforms", "trafo"

    NOTES: "wing" units, "proxy" orders and "transform" orders can only be
           used if the moderator has enabled the corresponding variant
           setting.

	   For "transform" orders in the adjustments phase, the order must
	   specify the new type of the unit.  For example, if the player has a
	   fleet in Brest, "Transform F Brest" will not do anything.
	   "Transform A Brest" will transform the fleet into an army (if that
	   is allowed by the current game settings).

Province names can be abbreviated or can be spelled out.  Valid abbreviations
can be found in the 'map' file for the variant you are playing (use the
command "GET MAP" for the standard map, or "GET map.xxx" for variant map
"xxx").  Coasts can be specified by following the province name with one of:

<coast>   = "/nc", "(nc)", "/north coast", "(north coast)"

replacing 'north' or 'n' with another valid direction if appropriate.
WARNING:  if you do not specify a coast for a fleet moving to a destination
province that contains coasts (including an order to support such a move),
the Judge will arbitrarily add a coast to the order (namely, the first one on
its list).  This may lead to unintended results!!

CONVOY ROUTES MUST BE SPECIFIED

Unlike human adjudicators, the Judge requires that convoy routes be
specified.  (See also file 'rules'.)  To do a convoy, you must order each
participating fleet to convoy the army, and also must order the army to
follow a specific convoy route.  For example:

     RIGHT                               WRONG

     A Lon-Nth-Nwy                       A Lon-Nwy
     F Nth C A Lon-Nwy                   F Nth C A Lon-Nwy

     A Bre-Mid-Wes-Lyo-Mar               A Bre-Mar
     F Mid C A Bre-Mar                   F Mid C A Bre-Mar
     F Wes C A Bre-Mar                   F Wes C A Bre-Mar
     F Lyo C A Bre-Mar                   F Lyo C A Bre-Mar

The "wrong" column is correct according to the standard rules of Diplomacy
and the usual practice in human-adjudicated games, but on the Judge it will
raise the error flag!  (Notes:  the convoying fleets do not have to belong to
the same power as the army, or as each other; but if the route specified for
the army does not match up exactly with the fleet orders, the convoy will
fail.  As shown above, only the army has to specify the entire route; the
fleets only need to give the origin and destination.)

REVISING ORDERS

Revisions to orders can be sent in any time before the phase is processed. 
Orders may be processed before the deadline unless the SET WAIT command has
been used (see file 'deadlines').  The last valid order for a particular unit
will be honored.  For Adjustment phases, if you submit more build orders than
you can use, the last one(s) received will be honored.  If no valid order is
received for a particular unit in an NMR game, it will be listed in the
reports as "No order processed".

SUBMITTING ORDERS IN ADVANCE

Orders can be submitted for future phases using the following syntax:

    PHASE <season> <year> <phase>

Where the first letter of the season or phase are significant:

    <season> = "Spring", "Summer", "Fall" or "Winter".
    <phase>  = "Movement", "Retreat", "Adjustment" or "Build".

The orders following the PHASE directive will be collected and saved
until the indicated phase occurs.  Some syntax checking will be done on
the orders, but the full list of errors can't be determined until the
actual phase occurs.  That error list will be mailed to you when the
orders are processed.  If any pending orders are found for a particular
phase, your power will get the "orders have been received" status
automatically whether or not there were any errors or if the orders are
incomplete.  All orders until the next PHASE directive or the end of
the mail message will be saved for the specified phase.  Note that only
orders are saved.  In particular, PRESS MESSAGES CANNOT BE DELAYED
for later transmission.  An exception to this is that the "SET WAIT"
and "SET NOWAIT" directives will be propagated to the future phase.
Your pending orders will be listed in replies to intervening order
submissions.  To get rid of all your pending orders, use the CLEAR
command.

As noted above, please be aware that subsequent build orders will
override earlier ones if more build orders are received than you have
supply centers.  Thus, when submitting orders for future build phases,
you should list your builds in reverse order of preference in case you
don't get as many supply centers as you were expecting.

CONDITIONAL ORDERS

Conditional statements can only be used after a PHASE command; they cannot
be used for the current phase's orders.  Phased orders can be entered
conditionally using the following syntax:

  IF <condition> [THEN]
    <orders>
  ELSE IF <condition> [THEN]
    <orders>
  [ELSE]
    <orders>
  [ENDIF]

The "THEN's" are optional for old Fortran programmers.  The conditions
are of the form:

<condition> = [NOT] [<power>] [<type>] <prov>

and may be combined with the keywords "AND" and "OR" evaluated left
to right.  You can use parenthesis to change the precedence.  The
condition evaluates to "true" if a unit of the specified type belonging
to the specified power is present (or not) in the specified province at the
beginning of the specified phase.  The province must be specified, but the
type and power are optional and interpreted as "any" if not specified.  The
power, type and province can be specified in any order.  Powers can be
abbreviated to two or more characters or spelled out.  For example:

   PHASE Fall 1905 Movement
   IF NOT French Army Ruhr AND (Russian Prussia OR Russian Silesia)
     Kiel -> Berlin
     Munich support Kiel -> Berlin
   ELSE
     Kiel -> Ruhr
     Munich support Kiel -> Ruhr
   ENDIF

Conditional statements can be nested with expected results.  The end of
a line closes off all parentheses and the end of the mail message closes
all open IFs without an error being reported.
