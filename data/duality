duality

Duality is where certain preset provinces, normally land only, can also
work as sea-spaces, to allow fleets there to make a convoy.

As this is a setting in the map file, only certain preset provinces can
have this behaviour.

At the time of writing, the variants and provinces affected are:

standard:	Constantinople, Denmark
1898:		Constantinople, Denmark
fleet_rome:	Constantinople, Denmark
britain:	Constantinople, Denmark
chaos:		Constantinople, Denmark
layered:	Constantinople1 & 2, Denmark1 & 2
milan:		Constantinople, Denmark
rootz:		Constantinople One and Two, Denmark One and Two
shift_around:	Constantinople, Denmark
shift_left:	Constantinople, Denmark
shift_right:	Constantinople, Denmark
wraparound:	Constantinople, Denmark
wraparound2:	Constantinople, Denmark
colonial:	Cebu
ancient_med:*	Baleares

(Games marked with '*' have this set as default.)

Note that when the game also has CostalConvoys allowed, this setting is
redundant.
