Greetings from the Diplomacy* Adjudicator!!                   August 31, 1990.
Deadlines.

Unless otherwise specified, orders will be processed on the following
schedule:

Moves   clock 1410 min 12.00 next 72.00 grace 168.00 delay 0.50 days --TWTF-
Retreat clock   -1 min  0.00 next 24.00 grace  72.00 delay 0.50 days --TWTF-
Adjust  clock   -1 min  0.00 next 24.00 grace  72.00 delay 0.50 days --TWTF-

The parameters are as follows:

clock:  If non-negative, indicates the minutes past midnight to which the
        initial deadline will be set.  1410 is eleven thirty pm.

min:    Indicates the minimum number of hours that can elapse between the
        previous phase and the new phase.  Thus, in the above example,
        there will be at least 12 hours after a build or retreat phase
        before the movement orders will be processed.  This parameter has
        no real use other than to prevent a runaway situation if all of
        the powers in a game were to go CD.

next:   Indicates the number of hours after the previous phase is 
        processed that the new deadline will be set.  This may be
        increased to fit into the values of the 'clock' and/or 'days'
        parameters.  In the default case, movement orders are three days
        after the previous phase.  However, because of the setting of
        days, if this falls on a weekend it will slide to Tuesday.

grace:  Indicates the number of hours the deadline will be extended if
        not everyone has gotten their orders in yet.  In the default
        case, a grace period of one week after the initial deadline is
        allowed.  When the deadline comes up, a reminder message will
        be sent to everyone who hasn't gotten their orders in and a
        notice will be sent to the other players and observers in the
        game indicating who is late.  The reminder will then be sent
        to the late parties every day.  If orders have still not been
        received within 24 hours of the grace period, a notice will
        be sent to all players and observers in that game indicating
        that the late power has been abandoned.  Abandoned powers may
        be taken over by anyone not already playing a power in the
        game merely by signing on with any password.  If orders
        are still not received before the grace period expires,
        that power will be marked "Civil Disorder" and the phase
        will be processed with incomplete orders.  On subsequent
        phases powers marked CD will not be considered when deciding
        whether the deadline should slide.  When a valid signon is
        received, the CD and/or abandonded status will be cleared.

delay:  Indicates the number of hours after the last required orders
        have been received before the orders will be processed.  The
        default for this is set such that if all powers get their
        orders in before the deadline, the orders will be processed one
        half hour later.  This gives people a little time to change
        their mind after orders are submitted.

days:   Specifies which days of the week are valid for the setting of
        the initial deadline.  This has no effect on the sliding of the
        deadline as specified by grace or delay.  An uppercase letter
        indicates that that day of the week is okay.  If the letter is
        lowercase, then the deadline is delayed until after noon.  A
        dash indicates that the deadline cannot fall on that day of the
        week.

These parameters can be changed with the set command.  In moderated games
only the master or moderator can use these commands.  For example:

        SET MOVES NEXT 48.0 DELAY 1.0
        SET BUILDS DELAY 1.0

In addition, the following commands can be used to affect the current
phase only:

   SET DEADLINE date   Affects the sending of the reminder.
   SET GRACE    date   Affects the limit on determining who goes CD.
   SET START    date   Affects the earliest orders will be processed.
   SET WAIT            Per user, specifies that orders should not be
   SET NOWAIT          or should be processed before the DEADLINE.

The dates in the above commands can be any combination of the three
letter abbreviation for the month, a day of the month, or hour-colon-
minute.  Any SET command except for SET PASSWORD, SET WAIT and SET
NOWAIT will generate a message that will be sent to all people
involved in the game indicating that you've been mucking around
with the game parameters.  Everyone active in the game should agree
before deadlines are adjusted.  Note, all times are based on the time
zone of the adjudicator.

Orders can be sent in anytime before the deadline.  If multiple
movement orders are received for the same unit, the most recent one
received will override the earlier one.  Attempting to build or debuild
too many units during the adjustments phase will cause the earliest
received build/debuild requests to be ignored.  Thus you can send in
preliminary movement orders immediately and then send in revised orders
after you change your mind from diplomatic talks.  Beware, though, that
if everyone gets their orders in before the deadline, the orders may be
processed before you have a chance to get your revised orders in.  If
you toss a "set wait" command into your orders, you can avoid having
your orders processed before the deadline.  When you've decided that
your orders are final, you can send in a message with a 'set nowait'
command to allow the orders to be processed as soon as the delay period
expires and everyone else has their orders in.  If the reply mail to
any order indicates that there was an error or you have a unit that you
did not supply an order for or you didn't explicitly specify all your
builds, debuilds or retreats, the flag indicating that your orders have
been received will not be set.  Note that all builds must be specified
or explicitly "waived" before the adjudicator will consider your build
orders complete unless it is impossible to build all units (eg: five
supply centers taken in a single year or no vacant home centers).  An
error free set of orders will be required to set the "has submitted
orders" status.  If no error free orders have been received by the time
the grace period expires, the partial orders will be processed and the
CD status will be set for your power.  See the discussion on grace
periods above for more info on what happens when you miss a deadline
and taking over abandoned powers.

The commands:

   SET NONMR
   SET NMR

can be used to set and clear a flag that forces the adjudicator to wait
until someone takes over an abandoned power before orders will be
processed.  This prevents a "No Moves Received" status for a power in
CD so that the game doesn't get lopsided when one power takes over a
defenseless neighbor.  The adjudicator will send out a reminder every
48 hours that it is waiting for someone to take over the abandoned
power(s) while the NONMR flag is set.

There are penalties for missing deadlines.  The judge attempts to keep
track of how dedicated you are to the game on the following schedule:

    +3 points for getting your orders in on time.
    -1 point  for each "deadline missed" reminder the judge sends you.
   -50 points for becoming abandoned.
  -100 points for missing the grace period and going CD.

There is no penalty for resigning before a deadline or if you submit
complete orders BEFORE you resign.  However, you will continue to
receive the -1 point penalty every day that your power remains
abandoned after the deadline.  If your power goes CD after you've
resigned without anyone else taking the power over, you will receive
the CD penalty as well (this is to discourage you from resigning when
you're down to a few units which could be used to affect the final
outcome of the game, but you've just lost interest).  Your rating on
this scale is displayed by the 'list' command.  Certain games can be
designated "only for dedicated players" with the command:

  set dedication -10

to prevent anyone with a dedication of less than negative 10 from signing
on.  Of course, if a game had a dedication setting greater than zero, you
would have to "prove yourself" in prior games before you could sign on or
take over an abandoned power in that game.
